# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.7.0

*Release date: 14th April 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Controller Events 
KubeSlice creates controller events and stores them in the `kubeslice-controller`
and `kubeslice-project` namespaces. The events can be retrieved using the corresponding YAML command.
For more information, see [controller events](../monitor/controller-events).

### Slice and Cluster Health
You can now monitor slice and cluster health using the corresponding description commands. 
For more information, see [slice and cluster health](../monitor/slice-cluster-health).

### Removal of the Cert Manager Dependency 
The `cert-manager` is no longer required to install the KubeSlice Controller on the controller cluster. 
With this version, the KubeSlice Controller supports upward compatibility. This means that the `cert-manager` 
installed does not have any impact on the KubeSlice Controller. However, the `cert-manager` is still 
required for the version 0.6.0 and older versions of the KubeSlice Controller to work.
