# KubeSlice Controller-generated Events

The KubeSlice Controller generates events that represents an operation that occurs on the controller
cluster. All of these generated events are specific to KubeSlice operations.

By default, the controller events are logged in the following namespaces:

- `kubeslice-controller`
- `kubeslice-project`

## kubeslice-project Namespace Events

This section describes the events that are generated on the `kubeslice-project` namespace.
Use the following command to get the `kubeslice-project` namespace events:

```
kubectl get events -n kubeslice-project
```

### Project

These events are related to the KubeSlice projects that you create on the controller cluster.

Use the following command to get the `kubeslice-controller` namespace events:

## Disable Controller Events

If you do not want to see a controller event, then you can list it under `disabledEvents` in
the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file that is located in the `kubeslice-controller`
namespace.

For example, if you don't want to see the `WorkerSliceConfigCreated` event, then go to
the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file using the following command:

```
kubectl edit cm kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf -n kubeslice-controller
```

In the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file, add the `WorkerSliceConfigCreated` event that you want
to hide under `disabledEvents` as illustrated below.

```
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
