## Disable Controller Events 
If you do not want to see a controller event, then you can list it under `disabledEvents` in 
the ``kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf`` file that is located in the `kubeslice-controller` 
namespace. 

For example, if you don't want to see the `NamespaceCreated` event, then go to 
the ``kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf`` file using the following command, 

```
kubectl edit cm kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf -n kubeslice-controller
```
In the ``kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf`` file, add the `NamespaceCreated` event that you want 
to hide under `disabledEvents` as illustrated below. 

```
disabledEvents:
- NamespaceCreated
```
