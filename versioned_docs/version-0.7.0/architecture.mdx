# Architecture  
KubeSlice provides network services to applications that need secure and highly available connectivity between 
multiple clusters. KubeSlice creates a flat overlay network to connect the clusters. The overlay network can be 
described as an application slice that provides a slice of connectivity between the pods of an application 
running in multiple clusters. It can also be described as an application-specific VPC that spans across 
clusters. Pods can connect to the slice overlay network and communicate with each other seamlessly across 
cluster boundaries. 

The connections between the clusters are secured by creating encrypted VPN tunnels that provide a safe passage 
to inter-cluster traffic. 

KubeSlice can also be used to enable service discovery and reachability across clusters. A Kubernetes service 
running in a cluster can be exported over the slice overlay network so that it is discovered and reached by 
pods running in other clusters.

The KubeSlice architecture consists of several components that interact with each other to manage the lifecycle 
of the slice overlay network. The diagram below shows the primary components of KubeSlice and the connections 
between them.

The controller cluster contains the KubeSlice Controller that manages user configuration and orchestrates the 
creation of the slice overlay network between multiple worker clusters. It defines and owns a number of CRDs 
that are used to store configuration and operational information in the cluster. The CRDs are also used in the 
interaction between the controller cluster and the worker clusters. The worker clusters connect to the 
Kubernetes API server of the controller cluster to fetch configuration that is stored in the custom resource 
objects.

The principal component of the worker clusters is the Slice Operator. It interacts with the controller cluster 
and sets up the needed infra for the slice overlay network on the worker cluster. The worker clusters also 
contain a DNS server called KubeSlice DNS that is used in inter-cluster service discovery. Users can also 
create slices with ingress and egress gateways for East-West (E-W) traffic. The Slice Operator provisions the 
gateways and setup routing rules to funnel traffic between the application pods and the gateway pods.
