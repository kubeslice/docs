# Install KubeSlice
Kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool designed to simplify KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes 
and cloud clusters. With this tool, you can easily install the necessary workloads to run the 
KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator on specific clusters. Additionally, it registers these 
clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster and manages slices across them.

To use the tool, you provide input in the form of YAML files. The topology YAML file describes 
the cluster membership in the multi-cluster. 

## Create Topology YAML file
To install KubeSlice, you need to create a topology configuration file that specifies the 
controller cluster and the worker cluster names. The file should include other relevant details 
as described in the sample configuration file provided below. This file is essential in setting 
up KubeSlice.


### Air-Gapped Installation

To install KubeSlice in Air-Gapped environment use local helm charts. Upgrade to the latest 
kubeslice-cli version 0.6.0 to use local charts.

Make sure you set the **use_local** value to `true` in the topology file:  

```
configuration:
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: # {The alias of the helm repo for KubeSlice Charts. For local charts provide the local path to the charts.}
    use_local: # {Use local charts instead of remote charts. Default is false}
```

### Custom Chart Values

Custom chart values can be specified in the topology configuration, see [Topology Configuration Parameters](/versioned_docs/version-1.3.0/install-kubeslice/kubeslice-cli/topology-configuration.mdx).
For example, you can add `values:metrics.insecure=true` under 
**configuration.helm_chart_configuration.worker_chart** for worker charts.

```
worker_chart:
        chart_name: kubeslice-worker
        values:
          "metrics.insecure": "true"
          "some.other.key": "value"
```

### Sample Topology Configuration File
The following a minimal configuration file to install KubeSlice on cloud clusters:

Create the topology configuration file using the following template:
```yaml
configuration:
  cluster_configuration:
    kube_config_path: <path to kubeconfig file>
    controller:
      name: <cluster name acting as controller>
      context_name: <controller cluster context name>
    workers:
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
  kubeslice_configuration:
    project_name: <create project name>
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: kubeslice
    repo_url: https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/
    cert_manager_chart:
      chart_name: cert-manager
    controller_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-controller
    worker_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-worker
```

### Sample Topology Configuration File for Air-Gapped Installation
The following a minimal configuration file to install KubeSlice on cloud clusters:

Create the topology configuration file using the following template:
```yaml
configuration:
  cluster_configuration:
    kube_config_path: <path to kubeconfig file>
    controller:
      name: <cluster name acting as controller>
      context_name: <controller cluster context name>
    workers:
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
  kubeslice_configuration:
    project_name: <create project name>
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: /usr/local
    use_local: true
    cert_manager_chart:
      chart_name: cert-manager
    controller_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-controller
    worker_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-worker
```


## Apply the Topology Configuration YAML
To install KubeSlice using the topology YAML file, use the following command:

```
kubeslice-cli --config <path-to-the-topology.yaml> install
```

:::success
You have successfully installed KubeSlice.
