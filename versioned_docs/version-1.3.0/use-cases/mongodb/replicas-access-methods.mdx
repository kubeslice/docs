# Replica Access Methods

After you deploy  MongoDB replica sets over the slice across multiple clusters, there are different deployment models 
you can use to access the replicas.

## Access Replicas from within the Clusters

In this deployment model, services deployed in different namespaces within the same slice can access any of the replica sets for 
read and write to the primary replica set.

### Step 1: Create the mongo.sh Namespace on the Master Cluster

 1. On the master cluster, create the mongo-sh namespace using the following command:

    ```
    kubectl create ns mongo-sh
    ```

2. Onboard the namespace to the slice by applying the MongoDB slice configuration using the following command:
 
   ``` 
   kubectl apply -f examples/distributed-mongodb/mongodb-slice/mongodb-slice-lb-mongo-sh.yaml
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy a MongoDB Shell Pod in the mongo-sh Namespace

Create and deploy a `mongodb-sh` pod in the mongo-sh namespace with the following configuration:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mongodb-sh
  namespace: mongo-sh
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mongodb-shell
      image: mongo:4.4.6 # You can adjust the version as needed
      command: ["sleep"]
      args: ["3600"]
      stdin: true
      tty: true
EOF
```

### Step 3: Connect to the MongoDB Multi-Replica Set from the MongoDB Shell Pod

1. Execute into the mongodb-sh container using the following command:

   
   ```
   kubectl exec -it mongodb-sh -c mongodb-shell -n mongo-sh -- sh
   ```

2. Inside the shell, connect to your MongoDB multi-replica set using the following command:

   ```
   mongo mongodb://multi-replica-set-0-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017,multi-replica-set-1-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017,multi-replica-set-2-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017
   ```


   
   Example Output
   
   ```
   MongoDB shell version v4.4.6
   connecting to: mongodb://multi-replica-set-0-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017,multi-replica-set-1-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017,multi-replica-set-2-0.mongodb.svc.slice.local:27017/?compressors=disabled&gssapiServiceName=mongodb

    ```

### Step 4: Perform Write Operations in the MongoDB Shell

After you are connected, you can perform write actions in the MongoDB shell and validate that the data is replicated across 
your MongoDB replica set deployment.

#### Disaster Recovery Failover

When the primary replica set fails over to a secondary replica set, the services can connect to the new primary and 
continue writing to it.

## Access Replicas from outside the Cluster

In this deployment model, MongoDB replicas will be offered as a service to external clients. The replica sets - primary and 
secondary - are accessed from clients via MongoDB service access points.

MongoDB replica set services will be exposed via LB service in each cluster with each replica set with its own FQDN. MongoDB 
clients can use the connection string to query the replica sets to determine the primary/secondary status of the replica sets 
and connect to primary for writes and reads for any of the replicas. With appropriate global DNS LB policies the read requests 
can connect to low-latency or geolocation based read replica set endpoints.
