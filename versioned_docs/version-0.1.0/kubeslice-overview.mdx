# KubeSlice Overview
---

## Introduction

KubeSlice combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment
in a multi-cluster, multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application **Slice** boundaries that allow
pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

## Why KubeSlice?

As enterprises expand application architectures to span multiple clusters located in data centers or cloud provider regions,
or across cloud providers, Kubernetes clusters need the ability to fully integrate connectivity and pod-to-pod communications
with namespace propagation across clusters.

KubeSlice enables creating multiple logical slices in a single cluster or group of clusters regardless of their physical location.
Existing intra-cluster communication remains local to the cluster utilizing each podâ€™s CNI interface. Kubeslice provides isolation
of network traffic between clusters by creating an overlay network for inter-cluster communication.

## KubeSlice Features

Services | Feature | Description
