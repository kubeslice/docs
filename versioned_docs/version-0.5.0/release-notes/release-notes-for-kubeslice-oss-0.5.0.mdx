# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.5.0

*Release date: 26th December 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice.
