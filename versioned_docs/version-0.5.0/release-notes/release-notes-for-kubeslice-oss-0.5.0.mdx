# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.5.0

*Release date: 28th December 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Network Service Mesh Upgrade 
The Network Service Mesh (NSM) component has been upgraded to the stable 
[GA version 1.5.0](https://networkservicemesh.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0/) 
that provides upstream networking fixes. 

### Latest Supported Kubernetes Version 
The latest Kubernetes version that we support from this release is version [1.24](https://v1-24.docs.kubernetes.io/). 

### Enhancements 
* When the namespace sameness is applied to a namespace on a slice, then it applies to all worker 
  clusters that are part of the slice. Now that namespace is created on a worker cluster if it does 
  not have that namespace. This ensures that all the worker clusters that are part of a slice will have that 
  namespace for which the namespace sameness is applied. This created namespace remains on the worker 
  cluster even after the worker cluster is detached from that slice, and even when that slice is deleted.

## Known Issues 
Istio version 1.13 is incompatible with Kubernetes version 1.24. It might cause issues with 
KubeSlice version 0.5.0, which now supports Kubernetes version 1.24. However, KubeSlice version 
0.5.0 can be installed without Istio too. 

We have described the usage of Istio in the following topics:
