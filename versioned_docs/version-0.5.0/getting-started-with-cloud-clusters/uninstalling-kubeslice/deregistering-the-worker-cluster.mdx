# Deregister the Worker Cluster

## Introduction 

This topic describes the steps to uninstall the Slice Operator, and thereby deregister 
your cluster from the KubeSlice Controller. The order of these steps is very important to 
ensure proper resource clean-up. Ensure that you have completed the tasks in the 
prerequisites.

## Prerequisites 

:::caution
Offboard all the namespaces from the slice before deleting it. To know
more, see [offboarding namespaces](/versioned_docs/version-0.5.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/uninstalling-kubeslice/offboarding-namespaces.mdx).

see [deleting the slice](/versioned_docs/version-0.5.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/uninstalling-kubeslice/deleting-the-slice.mdx).

## Uninstall the Slice Operator 

:::caution
You **must** delete all slices in a KubeSlice Controller cluster before uninstalling the 
Slice Operator in the worker cluster. Failing to do so can result in slices and 
resources not being cleaned up properly.
:::

After each slice is deleted from the KubeSlice Controller cluster, you
can uninstall the slice operator in the worker cluster.

Switch the context to the worker cluster using the following command:

``` 
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Uninstall the Slice Operator using the following command:

```
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME] -n kubeslice-system
```

Delete the CRDs of the Slice Operator using the following commands:

``` 
kubectl delete crd serviceexports.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd serviceimports.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slice.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slicegateways.networking.kubeslice.io
```

Delete the `kubeslice-system` namespace using the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete ns kubeslice-system
```

:::success
You have now uninstalled the Slice Operator from your registered cluster.

## Deregister your Worker Cluster

After uninstalling the Slice Operator successfully, deregister your worker cluster from 
the KubeSlice Controller.

Switch the context to the KubeSlice Controller cluster.

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Deregister a worker cluster using the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete clusters <cluster-name> -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

To deregister all worker clusters, use the following command:

```
kubectl delete clusters --all -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

:::success
You have now successfully deregistered the cluster from the KubeSlice Controller.
