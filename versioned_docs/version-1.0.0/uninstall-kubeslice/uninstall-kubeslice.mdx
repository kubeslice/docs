# Uninstall KubeSlice
This topic describes how to uninstall KubeSlice. Follow these steps to uninstall the KubeSlice Controller:

- Delete the ServiceExport for each application
- Offboard all namespaces from the slice
- Delete a slice
- Uninstall Slice operator
- Deregister the worker cluster
- Delete a project
- Uninstall the KubeSlice Controller

## Delete ServiceExports
If a ServiceExport was created in the application namespace, it must be deleted first.

Deleting the ServiceExport removes the corresponding ServiceImport automatically on all the clusters of the slice.

The below variables are required to delete the service export.

| Variables | Description |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------- 
| `<cluster name>` | The name of the cluster the application is deployed on.
| `<service export name>` | The name of the service export that you want to delete.
| `<namespace>` | The namespace the application is deployed on.

Switch the contexts to the cluster you deployed the application on:

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Use the following command to delete the ServiceExport from the cluster:

``` 
kubectl delete serviceexport <serviceexport name> -n <application namespace>
```
## Offboard Application Namespaces
To offboard the namespace from a slice, delete the `namespace` and the associated 
`clusters` under the `applicationNamespaces` in the slice configuration file as 
illustrated below.

``` 
  namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
     - namespace: iperf
       clusters:
       - '*'
     - namespace: bookinfo
       clusters:
       - '*'
```

For example, in the above slice configuration YAML file, if you want to offboard the 
BookInfo namespace from all clusters, edit the slice configuration YAML file and remove it 
from `applicationNamespaces` as illustrated below.

```
namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
     - namespace: iperf
       clusters:
       - '*'
```

To delete a slice, you must remove all the namespaces and the corresponding clusters. So, 
edit the slice configuration YAML file to remove them. After you remove the namespaces 
and the corresponding clusters, the application namespace configuration looks as 
illustrated below.

``` 
namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
```

Apply the slice configuration YAML to update the offboarded namespaces.

``` 
kubectl apply -f <slice configuration>.yaml -n <project namespace>
```

:::success
You have successfully offboarded the namespaces from the slice.
:::

## Delete Slices

:::caution
This step **must** be completed before uninstalling the Slice Operator. Failing to do so 
can result in slices and resources not being cleaned up properly.
:::

Switch the context to the controller cluster using the following command:

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

To delete an individual slice, use the following command:

```
kubectl delete sliceconfig <slice-name> -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

To delete all the slices, use the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete sliceconfig --all -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

:::success
You have successfully deleted the slice(s).
:::

## Uninstall the Slice Operator
:::caution
You **must** remove the cluster from all the slices it is connected to before uninstalling the 
Slice Operator in the worker cluster. Failing to do so can result in slices and 
resources not being cleaned up properly.
:::

After removing a cluster from all the slices, you can uninstall the Slice Operator 
in the worker cluster.

Switch the context to the worker cluster using the following command:

``` 
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Uninstall the Slice Operator using the following command:

```
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME] -n kubeslice-system
```

### Delete Slice Operator CRDs
Delete the CRDs of the Slice Operator using the following commands:

``` 
kubectl delete crd serviceexports.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd serviceimports.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slices.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slicegateways.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd sliceresourcequotas.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slicerolebindings.networking.kubeslice.io
kubectl delete crd slicenodeaffinities.networking.kubeslice.io
```
### Delete kubeslice-system Namespace
Delete the `kubeslice-system` namespace using the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete ns kubeslice-system
```
:::success
You have now uninstalled the Slice Operator from your registered cluster.
:::

## Deregister Worker Clusters
After uninstalling the Slice Operator successfully, deregister your worker cluster from 
the KubeSlice Controller.

Switch the context to the KubeSlice Controller cluster.

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Deregister a worker cluster using the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete clusters <cluster-name> -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

To deregister all worker clusters, use the following command:

```
kubectl delete clusters --all -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

:::success
You have now successfully deregistered the cluster from the KubeSlice Controller.
:::

## Delete a Project

:::caution
Before deleting a project, ensure all namespaces have been offboarded and the slice has been deleted.
:::

Delete a project after deregistering the worker cluster. The service account, namespaces, clusters, secrets, certificates, and tokens 
are all deleted when the project is deleted from the KubeSlice Controller.
   
Use the following command to delete the project:

```
kubeslice-cli delete project <project-name> -n <controller-namespace>
```

## Uninstall the KubeSlice Controller

### Uninstall the KubeSlice Controller

Uninstall the KubeSlice Controller using the following command:

``` 
helm uninstall kubeslice-controller -n kubeslice-controller
```
### Delete the kubeslice-controller Namespace

Delete the `kubeslice-controller` namespace using the following command:

```
kubectl delete ns kubeslice-controller
```
### Delete the Certificate Manager
Delete the Certificate Manager using the following command:

``` 
helm uninstall cert-manager -n cert-manager
```
### Delete the Certificate Manager Namespace

Delete the namespace `cert-manager` using the following command:

```
kubectl delete ns cert-manager
```

:::success
All set! KubeSlice Controller has been uninstalled from your cluster.
