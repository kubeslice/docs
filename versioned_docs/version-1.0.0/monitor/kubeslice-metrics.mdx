# KubeSlice Metrics
This topic describes the metrics of the KubeSlice Controller and the Worker Operator. These metrics 
help you in ensuring that all pods, slice, and other KubeSlice components are healthy. 

The metrics are tracked by configuring [alerts rules on Prometheus](alert-rules). 
The metric alerts can be [integrated with Slack](alert-manager-slack) to track them on a dedicated channel. 

## KubeSlice Controller Metrics
The metric below is common for all the components, which is distinguished by the corresponding label for each component.
