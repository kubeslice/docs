# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.3.0
*Release Date 12th September 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New

These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Standard QoS Profile
KubeSlice supports a standard QoS profile configuration in a separate YAML file. 
This QoS profile must be applied and called out as a standard QoS profile in 
a slice configuration. This is useful when you want to configure the same 
QoS profile on multiple slices. For more information, see 
[creating a standard QoS profile](/versioned_docs/version-1.0.0//getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/creating-a-slice.mdx#create-a-standard-qos-profile). 

## Bug Fixes
* The issue where the QoS traffic on a worker cluster did not work due to 
  an incorrect *node port* while passing conContext to the NetOp pod is fixed. The 
  issue has also occurred because the master node's *node IP address* was configured on 
  the worker cluster. You must always configure the *node IP address* of the worker cluster's gateway node 
  while installing the Slice Operator on the worker cluster.

* The issue where an exponential increase of goroutine threads in the Gateway Sidecar 
  component caused abrupt CPU utilization is fixed. The fix reduces the CPU utilization 
  by around 500 percent.
