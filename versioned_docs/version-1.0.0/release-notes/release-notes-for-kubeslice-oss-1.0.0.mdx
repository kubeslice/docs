# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.0.0

*Release date: 31st May 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Worker Operator-generated Events
The Worker Operator creates events and stores them in the `kubeslice-system` namespace. The events can 
be retrieved using the corresponding command.
For more information, see [the Worker Operator events](../monitor/worker-operator-events).
