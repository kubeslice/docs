# Monitor Slice and Cluster Health 
You can check the health of a slice and the worker clusters connected to it using the 
corresponding YAML commands. 

## Monitor Slice Health 
To monitor a slice's health: 

1. Get the list of worker clusters connected to a slice using the following command:
   ```
   kubectl get workersliceconfig -n kubeslice-<project>
   ```
   Example
   ```
   kubectl get workersliceconfig -n kubeslice-avesha
   ```

   Example Output
   ```
   NAME             AGE
   water-worker-1   54m
   water-worker-2   54m
   water-worker-3   54m
   ```

2. From the output, note down the name of a worker cluster and use it in the following command to 
   get the slice description:
   
   ```
   kubectl describe workersliceconfig <worker-cluster> -n kubeslice-<project>
   ```
   Example
   ```
   kubectl describe workersliceconfig water-worker-1 -n kubeslice-avesha
   ```

   Example Output

   The output below is an excerpt of the command output to only show the health status.

     Component Statuses:
       Component:                dns
       Component Health Status:  Normal
       Component:                slicegateway
       Component Health Status:  Normal
       Component:                slicerouter

     Last Updated:               2023-04-10T08:54:08Z
     Slice Health Status:        Normal

When all the components are in a healthy state, the corresponding status indicates that 
the health is **Normal**. 

When a component's health goes bad, the corresponding status indicates the health 
with a **Warning**. To know how to trace an issue in each component, see [slice and cluster health issues](/versioned_docs/version-1.0.0/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide.mdx#slice-and-cluster-health-issues).

## Monitor Cluster Health 
To monitor a cluster's health: 

1. Get the list of worker clusters using the following command:

   ```
   kubectl get clusters -n kubeslice-<project>
   ```
   
   Example
   ```
   kubectl get clusters -n kubeslice-avesha
   ```
   Example Output
   ```
   NAME       AGE
   worker-1   76m
   worker-2   75m
   worker-3   76m
   ```

2. From the output, note down a worker cluster that you want to monitor and use it in the following 
   command to get the cluster description:

   ```
   kubectl describe clusters <worker-cluster> -n kubeslice-<project>
   ```

   Example

   ```
   kubectl describe clusters worker-1 -n kubeslice-avesha
   ```

   Example Output 

   :::info 
   The output below is an excerpt of the command output to only show the health status.

   ```

         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                forwarder
         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                admission-webhook
         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                netop
         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                spire-agent
         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                spire-server
         Component Health Status:  Normal
         Component:                istiod
         Component Health Status:  Normal
   ```

When all the components are in a healthy state, the corresponding status indicates that 
the health is **Normal**. 

When a component's health is bad, the corresponding status indicates the health 
with a **Warning**. To know how to trace an issue in each component, see [slice and cluster health issues](/versioned_docs/version-1.0.0/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide.mdx#slice-and-cluster-health-issues).
