# Install kubeslice-cli

## Introduction 
kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool that allows you to perform KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes and cloud clusters. 
It simplifies the process to install and uninstall the workloads needed to run KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator in the specified clusters. 
This tool registers those clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster, and administer slices across those clusters.

The tool takes input in the form of YAML files that describe the membership of clusters in the multi-cluster (the `topology` YAML file) 
as well as the definition of slices across those clusters (the `slice configuration` YAML file). Given those YAML files, it simplifies 
installation of KubeSlice by performing all of the necessary configuration steps to apply the appropriate config to each cluster. 
You can install KubeSlice on your existing kind or cloud clusters. 

Alternatively, to get familiar with KubeSlice, you can create a multicluster using kind clusters. Use the 
`kubeslice-cli install â€”profile` option to create a demo setup consisting of one controller and two worker clusters.
