# Installing kubeslice-cli

## Introduction 

kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool designed to simplify KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes 
and cloud clusters. With this tool, you can easily install and uninstall the necessary 
workloads to run the KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator on specific clusters. Additionally, 
it registers these clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster configuration and manages slices across them.

To use the tool, you provide input in the form of YAML files. The topology YAML file describes 
the cluster membership in the multi-cluster configuration, while the slice configuration YAML 
file defines slices across these clusters. By using these YAML files, kubeslice-cli simplifies 
the KubeSlice installation process by configuring each cluster appropriately. This way, you 
can install KubeSlice on your on-premises or cloud clusters without any hassle.
