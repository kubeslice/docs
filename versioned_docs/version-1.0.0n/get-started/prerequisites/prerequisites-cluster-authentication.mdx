# Cluster Authentication 
Before registering each worker cluster with the KubeSlice Controller, you must 
authenticate with each cloud provider used in the installation.

To register your worker clusters with the KubeSlice Controller, it is 
necessary to authenticate with each cloud provider used in the installation. 
To accomplish this, run the commands below to retrieve the relevant kubeconfig file 
and add it to your default kubeconfig path.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 
For information on prerequisites and authentication, see [Microsoft AKS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-credentials).
The following information is required to retrieve your Microsoft Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**      |        **Description** |
|-----|-----|
| <resource group name\> |  The name of the resource group the cluster belongs to.
  <cluster name\>         | The name of the cluster you would like to get credentials for.|

The following command retrieves your AKS cluster `kubeconfig` and add it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each
AKS cluster in the configuration.

``` 
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource group name> --name <cluster name>
```

## AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
For information on prerequisites and other required details, see the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

The following information is required to retrieve your Elastic Kubernetes
Service (EKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<cluster name\>  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  <cluster region\>       |  The AWS region the cluster belongs to.|

 
The following command retrieves your EKS cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each EKS
cluster in the configuration.

``` 
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <cluster-region>  
```

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
For information on the prerequisites and other required details, see [Google Cloud CLI Docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials).

The following information is required to retrieve your Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<cluster name\>  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  <region\>       |  The region the cluster belongs to.|
| <project id\>    | The project ID that the cluster belongs to.|
 

The following command retrieves your GKE cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each GKE
cluster in the configuration.

``` 
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --region <region> --project <project id>
```

Expected Output

``` 
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for <cluster name>
```
