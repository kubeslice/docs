| **Cluster Requirements**          | 1 Kubernetes Cluster                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Node Requirements**             | KubeSlice needs at least two nodes each with a minimum of 4 vCPUs and 16GB of RAM. We highly recommend creating a separate NodePool for KubeSlice components to improve performance and simplify management. |
| **Supported Kubernetes Versions** | [1.23](https://v1-23.docs.kubernetes.io/) and [1.24](https://v1-24.docs.kubernetes.io/)                                                                                                                      |
| **Supported Kubernetes Services** | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)                                                                    |
| **Required Helm Version**         | 3.7.0                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

:::info
KubeSlice has been tested on AKS, GKE, and EKS, but it should run in any Kubernetes
environment with the supported Kubernetes versions.

:::info
In an intra-slice scenario, a single cluster can serve as both a controller cluster and a 
worker cluster. This allows KubeSlice to segment the cluster into application slices. This 
enables you to better manage and isolate your applications, improving the overall efficiency 
and performance of your cluster.
