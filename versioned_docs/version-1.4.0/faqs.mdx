## Usage and Benefits

<details>
<summary>How is KubeSlice useful to me?</summary>
<p>
KubeSlice creates a flat, secure virtual network overlay for streamlined data distribution and communication between 
distributed workloads. It enables multi-tenancy and reduces deployment time, complexity, and costs for multi-cloud, hybrid 
cloud, and edge environments. KubeSlice seamlessly integrates with the Kubernetes ecosystem.

<details>
<summary>How do I use KubeSlice to onboard applications?</summary>
<p>
KubeSlice supports slice creation. A slice can be connected to worker clusters, and 
applications from those connected clusters can be onboarded onto the slice. 
To learn more, see [onboarding applications](/versioned_docs/version-1.4.0/install-kubeslice/yaml/slice-operations/slice-operations-slice-creation.mdx#onboard-namespaces).

<details>
<summary>How do I distribute my applications across clusters?</summary>
<p>
You can onboard applications from your cluster onto a slice by onboarding namespaces and create a service export to 
distribute applications across clusters. The other clusters must also be part of that slice.
To learn more, see [Service Export](/versioned_docs/version-1.4.0/install-kubeslice/yaml/slice-operations/slice-operations-slice-creation.mdx#serviceexports-and-serviceimports).
