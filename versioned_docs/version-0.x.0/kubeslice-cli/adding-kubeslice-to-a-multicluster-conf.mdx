# Installing KubeSlice

There are the five main steps for installing the KubeSlice:

- Installing the KubeSlice Controller
- Creating the project
- Registering the worker clusters
- Creating the slices
- Onboarding namespaces onto the slices

This topic describes the steps the add KubeSlice to your existing multi-cluster configuration.

## Adding kubeslice to a multi-cluster configuration
The Kubeslice Controller and the worker clusters can be installed by using topology configuration file. 

## Installing the KubeSlice Controller and Worker clusters

You must build you topology configuration file which includes the cluster names and cluster contexts
that hosts the KubeSlice Controller and the worker clusters. For more information, see sample 
[Topology Configuration](versioned_docs\version-0.x.0\kubeslice-cli\example\sample-configuration-file.mdx) file.

Use the following command to install the controller and worker clusters:
```
kubeslice-cli install --config=<topology-configuration-file>
```

## Onboarding Namespaces

To onboard your existing namespaces (and their applications) onto a slice:
- Build your slice definition file (choose the namespaces, clusters, etc to be part of the slice)
- Run kubeslice-cli create sliceConfig

:::caution
If your application is already deployed on a namespace you onboarded to a slide, re-deploy it (and specify ServiceExport in your deployment spec).
