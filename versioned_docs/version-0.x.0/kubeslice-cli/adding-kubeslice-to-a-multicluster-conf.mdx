# Installing KubeSlice

There are the five main steps for installing the KubeSlice:

- Installing the KubeSlice Controller
- Creating the project
- Registering the worker clusters
- Creating the slices
- Onboarding namespaces onto the slices

This topic describes the steps the add KubeSlice to your existing multi-cluster configuration.

## Adding KubeSlice to a Multi-Cluster Configuration
The Kubeslice Controller and worker clusters can be installed on your existing mutli-cluster configuration by using a topology configuration file. 

## Installing the KubeSlice Controller and Worker Clusters

You must create a topology configuration file that includes the names of the clusters and cluster contexts
that hosts the KubeSlice Controller and the worker clusters. For more information, see sample 
[Topology Configuration](versioned_docs\version-0.x.0\kubeslice-cli\example\sample-configuration-file.mdx) file.

Use the following command to install the controller and worker clusters:
```
kubeslice-cli install --config=<topology-configuration-file>
```

## Onboarding Namespaces

To onboard your existing namespaces (and their applications) onto a slice, follow these steps:
- Create a slice definition file (choose the namespaces, clusters, etc to be part of the slice).
- Use the `kubeslice-cli create sliceConfig` command to apply the slice configuration file.

:::caution
If the application is already deployed on a namespace that is onboarded to a slice, then re-deploy the application (specify ServiceExport in your deployment spec).
