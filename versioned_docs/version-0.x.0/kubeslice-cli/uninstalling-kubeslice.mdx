:::info
The order of operations in uninstalling the KubeSlice Controller is important to ensure all resources are cleaned up properly. Follow the 
order of operations provided under this topic.
:::

## Offboarding Namespaces
To offboard the namespaces from slice, you must first delete the serviceexport for each application. For more information, see 
[Offboarding Namespaces](https://docs.avesha.io/documentation/open-source/0.4.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/uninstalling-kubeslice/offboarding-namespaces).

 
## Deleting the Slice
You must Offboard all the namespaces from the slice before deleting it. Before uninstalling the Slice Operator, this step must be completed.
Failure to do so may result in slices and resources not being properly cleaned up.

To delete a slice, use the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli delete sliceConfig <sliceConfig-name> -n <project namespace>
```
   
## Deregistering the Worker Cluster
:::caution
Before deregistering the worker cluster ensure you have offboarded the namespaces and deleted the slice.
::: 

You must first uninstall the Slice Operator from the worker cluster before deregistering it from the controller cluster.

To delete a registered worker cluster, use the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli delete worker <worker-name> -n <project-namespace>
```

## Deleting the Project
:::caution
Before deleting a project ensure you have offboarded the namespaces and deleted the slice(s).
:::
After deregistered the worker cluster, delete a project. Deleting the project from the KubeSlice Controller
deletes the service account, namespaces, clusters, secrets, certificates, and tokens.
   
To delete a project, use the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli delete project <project-name> -n <controller-namespace>
```
