## Create Clusters and Slices
The response email that you receive after you register contains the details about 
how to access the KubeSlice on the sandbox environment. 

Using the shared credentials, try our KubeSlice seamlessly for four hours using the kubeslice-cli tool! 

:::info
You will receive an expiration-reminder email an hour (60 minutes) before your access expires.

Now with the access to your sandbox virtual machine (VM), a few tasks that you can do are:

* Run `kubeslice-cli install --profile=full-demo` to get a full environment setup for you. This setup 
  provides you three kind clusters. You can use this setup to explore and learn about KubeSlice without installing anything.
 To know more, see [kubeslice-cli](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/install-kubeslice/kubeslice-cli/install-kubeslice-cli.mdx)
* If you want to practice installing Kubeslice, you can do the 
  [minimal-demo](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/tutorials/kubeslice-cli-tutorials/kubeslice-cli-demo.mdx).    
* If you are a contributor, you can install a topology, clone your repo to the sandbox VM, and 
  try out your modifications.

  :::warning
  Remember that the sandbox environment expires in **four hours**, which will erase all the local content if you don't save it. 
  Be sure to save your work on your local system.
