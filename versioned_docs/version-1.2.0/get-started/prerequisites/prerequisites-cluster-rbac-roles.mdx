# Required Cluster Roles (RBAC) 
Installing the KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator **requires admin privileges** on the 
Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, only a user with the Kubernetes cluster admin role can 
perform this task. The correct name of the RBAC role for admin privileges in Kubernetes is 
`cluster-admin`.
