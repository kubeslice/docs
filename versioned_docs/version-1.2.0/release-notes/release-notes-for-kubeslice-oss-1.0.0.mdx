# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.0.0

*Release date: 31st May 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Worker Operator-generated Events
The Worker Operator generates events in the `kubeslice-system` namespace. The events can 
be retrieved using the corresponding command.
For more information, see [the Worker Operator events](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/install-kubeslice/yaml/events/yaml-events-controller-events.mdx).

### KubeSlice Metrics 
KubeSlice now records custom metrics that helps in monitoring the slice, and other KubeSlice 
components. These Prometheus metrics can be configured as alerts using the alert manager.   
For more information, see [KubeSlice metrics](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/install-kubeslice/yaml/metrics/yaml-metrics-controller-metrics.mdx).

### Event Integration on Slack 
KubeSlice-generated events can be integrated on slack to track them on a separate application workspace.

For more information, see [integrate KubeSlice-generated events on Slack](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/add-ons/add-ons-slack-events.mdx).

### Metric-based Alerts Integration with Slack
KubeSlice metric-based alerts can be integrated with Slack for brownfield and greenfield Prometheus deployments. 
This integration facilitates tracking the metric-based alerts on a dedicated Slack channel. 
For more information, see [integrate alerts with Slack](/versioned_docs/version-1.2.0/add-ons/add-ons-slack-metrics.mdx).
