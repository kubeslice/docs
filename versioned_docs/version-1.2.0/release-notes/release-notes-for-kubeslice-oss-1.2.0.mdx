# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.2.0

*Release date: 16th Jan 2024*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.


### KubeSlice Supports Cluster Connectivity between Public and Private Clusters
KubeSlice now supports cluster connectivity to private clusters. This feature is currently configurable only using YAML.

With this release, we remove the restriction for the cluster to have at least one node with a public IP address to make 
it part of the KubeSlice overlay network. Enabling a node with a public IP restricted the application of KubeSlice on 
private cloud clusters where the virtual private clouds filter out external traffic.

With the new feature, KubeSlice extends its usage to such private cloud clusters through a network load balancer which 
can be provisioned and managed by all major cloud providers.
