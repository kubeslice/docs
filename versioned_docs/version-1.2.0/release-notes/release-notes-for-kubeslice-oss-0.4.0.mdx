# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.4.0

*Release date: 12th October 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### IP Address Management 
For managing and monitoring IP addresses on a slice, a new parameter has been introduced 
to configure the maximum number of clusters that can be connected to a slice. This parameter 
is configurable only during slice creation. The value is immutable after the slice creation.   

For more information, see the [slice configuration](/versioned_docs/version-1.0.0//getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/creating-a-slice.mdx#create-the-slice-yaml-file).
