# off-boarding Namespaces

## Introduction 

off-boarding namespaces from slice is an easy and straightforward process. This topic
describes the steps to off-board namespaces before you delete your slice.

:::caution
If your application is installed on multiple clusters within a slice, you must complete these steps for each cluster.

## Deleting the ServiceExport for Each Application

:::info
If a ServiceExport was created in the application namespace, it must be
deleted first.
:::

:::info
Deleting the ServiceExport removes the corresponding ServiceImport
automatically on all the clusters of the slice.
:::

| Variables | Description |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------- 
| <cluster name\> | The name of the cluster the application is deployed on.|
|<serviceexport name\> | The name of the service export that you want to delete.|
| <namespace\> | The namespace the application is deployed on.|

Switch the contexts to the cluster you deployed the application on:

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Use the following command to delete the ServiceExport from the cluster:

``` 
kubectl delete serviceexport <serviceexport name> -n <application namespace>
```

## off-boarding Namespaces from the Slice Configuration 

To off-board the namespace from a slice, delete the `namespace` and the associated 
`clusters` under the `applicationNamespaces` in the slice configuration file as 
illustrated below.

``` 
  namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
     - namespace: iperf
       clusters:
       - '*'
     - namespace: bookinfo
       clusters:
       - '*'
```

For example, in the above slice configuration YAML file, if you want to off-board the 
Bookinfo namespace from all clusters, edit the slice configuration YAML file and remove it 
from `applicationNamespaces` as illustrated below.

```
namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
     - namespace: iperf
       clusters:
       - '*'
```

To delete a slice, you must remove all the namespaces and the corresponding clusters. So, 
edit the slice configuration YAML file to remove them. After you remove the namespaces 
and the corresponding clusters, the application namespace configuration looks as 
illustrated below.

``` 
namespaceIsolationProfile:
    applicationNamespaces:
```

Apply the slice configuration YAML to update the off-boarded namespaces.

``` 
kubectl apply -f <slice configuration>.yaml -n <project namespace>
```

:::success
You have successfully off-boarded the namespaces from the slice.
