# Isolating Namespaces

## Introduction
The namespace isolation feature allows you to confine application namespaces to a slice. The associated namespaces
are connected to the slice and are isolated from other namespaces in the cluster. This forms a secure inter-cluster
network segment of pods, that are isolated from the rest of the pods in the clusters. The slice segmentation isolates
and protects applications from each other, and reduces blast radius of failure conditions.

The following figure illustrates how the namespaces are isolated from different namespaces on a worker cluster.
Namespaces are isolated with respect to sending and receiving data traffic to other namespaces in a cluster.

## Enabling Namespace Isolation
Namespace isolation is enabled by setting the isolationEnabled parameter to true and disabled by setting the
same parameter to false in the slice configuration file. To know more, see [namespace isolation profile parameters](/versioned_docs/version-0.3.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/configuration-parameters.mdx#namespace-isolation-profile-parameters)
and the [slice configuration YAML](/versioned_docs/version-0.3.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/creating-a-slice.mdx#creating-the-slice-yaml-file) file.

When the namespace isolation feature is enabled, the namespace isolation policy is 
applied to isolate the application namespaces. Verify the namespace isolation policy by 
running the following command to confirm that the namespace isolation feature is enabled:
```
kubectl get netpol -n <application_namespace>
```
Expected Output

```
NAME                  POD-SELECTOR            AGE
peacock-bookinfo      <none>                  15s
```

In the above output, `peacock` is the slice name and `bookinfo` is the onboarded 
namespace to which the namespace isolation policy is applied.
