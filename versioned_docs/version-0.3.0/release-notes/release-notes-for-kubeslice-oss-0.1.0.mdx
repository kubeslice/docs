# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.1.0

*Release date: 16th May 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries which allow pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centres. 

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

 

## Whatâ€™s New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

## KubeSlice Controller
The KubeSlice Controller orchestrates the creation and management of application slices on worker clusters. It is independent of any cloud provider and thus it: 

* Supports  installation in any Kubernetes cluster (on-premise or cloud) 
* Makes it easy to design hybrid cloud solutions
* The KubeSlice Controller components and the worker cluster components can coexist on the same cluster.
 

## Slice Operator 
Slice Operator, also known as Worker Operator is a component of KubeSlice that must be installed on the worker cluster to interact with the KubeSlice Controller. It acts as an interface between the worker cluster and the KubeSlice Controller. It watches the configuration changes on the KubeSlice Controller and sets up the required infrastructure to create the slice overlay network. Slice Operators on worker clusters participate in inter-cluster discovery to enable service reachability across cluster boundaries. The Slice Operator can communicate directly with the KubeSlice Controller and get the configuration changes related to the registered cluster, also known as worker cluster.

## Supported Kubernetes Services 
This version of KubeSlice has been tested on Azure Kubernetes Service and Google Kubernetes Engine, and KIND Kubernetes clusters. The supported Kubernetes versions are [1.20](https://v1-20.docs.kubernetes.io/), [1.21](https://v1-21.docs.kubernetes.io/), and [1.22](https://v1-22.docs.kubernetes.io/).

 

## Known Issues 
A slice can be deleted with onboarded applications, which would cause disruptions. Ensure to delete a slice only after all the applications are detached from the slice.
