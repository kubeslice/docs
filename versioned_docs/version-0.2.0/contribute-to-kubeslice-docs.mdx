# Contributing to the KubeSlice Documentation

_KubeSlice welcomes suggestions for improvement from all contributors, new and experienced!_

You can contribute to the KubeSlice documentation by

- Improving existing content
- Suggesting new content

## Getting Started

Everybody is welcome to suggest changes by submitting a pull request
or report a bug/typo with the help of a GitHub issue to the
[docs](https://github.com/kubeslice/docs) repository.

## Prerequisites 

Below is the list of things you should be aware of before getting started with your contribution journey to the KubeSlice documentation:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)
    - Docusaurus is a static site generator that makes use of the Markdown syntax and uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as the parser.

## Making your First Contribution!

- Familiarize yourself with the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubeslice/docs) hosting the documentation.
- Whether you’re suggesting an improvement or adding new content, you will need to open an issue first.
	- Refer to our section on opening an issue below to learn more.


## Opening an Issue

The first step to begin work whether you’re suggesting an improvement or adding new content is to open an issue.

Follow the below steps to open an issue

- Click the "Edit this page" button at the bottom of the page.
- Navigate to the Issues tab and click New issue.
- Describe the issue or suggestion for improvement. The more details you provide, the better!
- Click Submit new issue.
- After submitting the issue, you can either assign it to yourself or wait for a community member to pick it up. Members of the documentation team and the community might request clarifications before they can take action on your issue, so we request that you actively check your issue or [turn on GitHub notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

## How Do I Make My Contribution Count?

No contribution is too big or small! However, to ensure that the community derives maximum value, we request that you follow the below when reporting an issue:

- Focus on providing a clear description of the issue. Some key points to consider would be specifically describing what is missing, outdated, erroneous, or requires qualitative/technical improvement.
- Detail the specific impact the issue has on users.
- Delimit the scope of the issue. If the scope is larger, we'd request you to break it down into smaller tasks within an issue. For example, **Creating a Contribution Guide** is very wide in scope since there would be multiple tasks associated with the issue. However,**Fixing a grammatical error on the quick start page** is a more narrowly scoped issue that would, potentially, require only a single pull request.
- Crosscheck existing issues to avoid duplicate work.
- Check for an existing pull request or issue as there is a fair chance that you're opening an issue that has been referenced before. Ensure you reference the existing issue or pull request within the issue you're opening to provide context for contributors who may want to work on it.
