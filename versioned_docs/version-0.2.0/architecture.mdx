# KubeSlice Architecture 

## Introduction
KubeSlice provides network services to applications that need secure and highly available connectivity between 
multiple clusters. KubeSlice creates a flat overlay network to connect the clusters. The overlay network can be 
described as an application slice that provides a slice of connectivity between the pods of an application 
running in multiple clusters. It can also be described as an application-specific VPC that spans across 
clusters. Pods can connect to the slice overlay network and communicate with each other seamlessly across 
cluster boundaries. 

The connections between the clusters are secured by creating encrypted VPN tunnels that provide a safe passage 
to inter-cluster traffic. 

KubeSlice can also be used to enable service discovery and reachability across clusters. A Kubernetes service 
running in a cluster can be exported over the slice overlay network so that it is discovered and reached by 
pods running in other clusters.

The KubeSlice architecture consists of several components that interact with each other to manage the lifecycle 
of the slice overlay network. The diagram below shows the primary components of KubeSlice and the connections 
between them.

The controller cluster contains the KubeSlice Controller that manages user configuration and orchestrates the 
creation of the slice overlay network between multiple worker clusters. It defines and owns a number of CRDs 
that are used to store configuration and operational information in the cluster. The CRDs are also used in the 
interaction between the controller cluster and the worker clusters. The worker clusters connect to the 
Kubernetes API server of the controller cluster to fetch configuration that is stored in the custom resource 
objects.

The principal component of the worker clusters is the Slice Operator. It interacts with the controller cluster 
and sets up the needed infra for the slice overlay network on the worker cluster. The worker clusters also 
contain a DNS server called KubeSlice DNS that is used in inter-cluster service discovery. Users can also 
create slices with ingress and egress gateways for East-West (E-W) traffic. The Slice Operator provisions the 
gateways and setup routing rules to funnel traffic between the application pods and the gateway pods.

## KubeSlice Components
KubeSlice consists of the following main components deployed in one 
or more gateway nodes that work in conjunction to securely connect 
workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters located in data centers, 
public clouds, or edge locations:

* [KubeSlice Controller](#kubeslice-controller)
* [Slice Operator](#slice-operator)
* [Slice VPN Gateways](#slice-vpn-gateways)
* [Slice Router](#slice-router)
* [Slice Istio Components](#slice-istio-components)
* [KubeSlice DNS](#kubeslice-dns)
* [Network Service Mesh Control and Data Plane](#network-service-mesh-control-and-data-plane)
* [NetOps](#netops)

### KubeSlice Controller
The KubeSlice Controller is installed in one of the clusters and 
provides a central configuration management system, for slices across multiple clusters. 

We recommend that you install the KubeSlice Controller on a separate cluster.

The KubeSlice Controller provides:

A communication interface through which Slice Operators on multiple clusters can connect to 
it. The slice configuration that includes slice VPN gateway, service discovery with service 
import/export, and ingress/egress gateway related parameters are relayed to the Slice 
Operators on registered clusters.

Creation and management of cryptographic certificates for secure slice VPN gateways.

APIs through the API Gateway for the KubeSlice Manager to create and manage the application slices. 

### Slice Operator
The Slice Operator, also known as a Worker Operator is a Kubernetes Operator component 
that manages the life-cycle of the KubeSlice related Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

The Slice Operator performs the following functions:

* Interacts with the KubeSlice controller to receive slice configuration updates.
* Reconciliation of slice resources in the cluster KubeSlice Controller.
* Creation of slice components required for Slice VPN Gateway connectivity and Service Discovery.
* Auto insertion and deletion of slice components to accommodate topology changes.
* Lifecycle management of slices, slice configurations, slice status, and slice telemetry.
* Lifecycle management of network policies and monitoring of configuration drift to generate slice events and alerts.
* Management of the association of slices with namespaces
* Interaction with the KubeSlice Controller to:

  - Facilitate network policy and service discovery across the slice.
  - Import/export Istio services to/from the other clusters attached to the slice.
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing the slice components.

### Slice VPN Gateways
The Slice VPN Gateway is a slice network service component that provides a secure VPN 
tunnel between multiple clusters that are a part of the slice configuration.

The Slice Operator performs the following life-cycle functions for Slice VPN Gateways:

* Interacts with the KubeSlice controller to receive configuration related to slice gateways.
* Maintains cryptographic keys and certificates needed for secure VPN tunnels.
* Deploys and reconciles slice VPN gateway pods.
* Periodically monitors the status of the gateway pods.
* Continuously interacts with Slice VPN Gateways for status, keys/certificates, and configuration changes.

KubeSlice Controller manages the VPN gateway pairs for the attached clusters, and creates the 
keys & configurations required for the operation. 

### Slice Router
A slice router is a virtual layer 3 device that sets up the routing and forwarding rules 
in the slice overlay network. A minimum of one slice router pod is provisioned per slice 
on a cluster.

The slice operator manages the life cycle of the slice router deployment and monitors its 
status periodically.

### Slice Istio Components
KubeSlice provides the option of setting up ingress and egress gateways for a slice using 
Istio Service Mesh resources. Ingress/Egress gateway is not a core component of KubeSlice, 
it is an add-on feature that users can activate if needed. The Istio components must be 
installed in the cluster before the KubeSlice components are installed or they can be 
installed as a part of the KubeSlice installation itself.

Slice Ingress/Egress Gateways are used for internal East-West traffic (inter-cluster, egress from one cluster, and ingress into another cluster) and Slice North-South Ingress Gateway for external traffic. 

### KubeSlice DNS
KubeSlice DNS is a DNS server that is used to resolve service names exposed on application slices.

The Slice Operator manages the DNS entries for all the services exposed on the slice overlay network(s).

When a service is exported on the slice by installing a ServiceExport object, a DNS entry 
is created in the KubeSlice DNS server in all the clusters that are part of the slice.

### Network Service Mesh Control and Data Plane
The Network Service Mesh (NSM) component sets up the Kubeslice data plane and connects application pods to the 
slice overlay network. It consists of:

* NSM Control plane daemon set
* NSM Data plane daemon set
* NSM admission webhook controller pod
* NSM CRD objects that facilitate setting up the slice overlay network

### NetOps
Each slice in a cluster is associated with a QoS profile for bandwidth control across the 
clusters. The QoS profile is applied to the external interface of the VPN gateway nodes. 
NetOps pods configure and enforce the QoS profile for a slice on a cluster.
