### Installing the Slice Operator 
After registering the worker cluster with the KubeSlice Controller, you must install the 
Slice Operator in your worker cluster.

To install the Slice Operator, get the secrets for the worker cluster from the KubeSlice 
Controller manually. Use these secrets in your values .yaml file to install the Slice 
Operator. 

:::info
Alternatively, you can use the script to create your values.yaml file as described in 
[Script to Get the Secrets of the Worker Cluster](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/script-to-get-the-secrets-of-the-worker-cluster.mdx).

#### Getting the Secrets of the Registered Cluster from the Controller Cluster 
After registering the worker cluster with the KubeSlice Controller, a secret gets listed 
under the Project namespace. The secret contains access information that you must add in 
the Slice Operator YAML file. The secret is required for the worker cluster to communicate 
with the KubeSlice Controller. 

:::info
You can also retrieve the secrets of the worker clusters using these 
[scripts](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/script-to-get-the-secrets-of-the-worker-cluster.mdx).

To get the secrets:

1. Get the list of secrets belonging to the project namespace using the
   following command:

   ```
   kubectl get secrets -n kubeslice-<project name>
   ```

   Example

   ```
   kubectl get secrets -n kubeslice-avesha
   ```   

   Example Output

   ```
   NAME                                              TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
   default-token-mzh9h                               kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      30s
   kubeslice-rbac-rw-user-token-lf4zg                kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      30s
   kubeslice-rbac-worker-kind-worker-1-token-mw9vp   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   5      30s
   kubeslice-rbac-worker-kind-worker-2-token-pksp5   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   5      30s
   ```

   The name of the secret is in this format: ` kubeslice-rbac-<registered cluster secret name>-token.`
   For example, `kubeslice-rbac-worker-kind-worker-1-token-mw9vp` - this secret is meant 
   for a worker cluster that was registered using the name kind-worker-1.

2. Retrieve the details of the secret using the following command:

   ```
   kubectl get secrets <worker-cluster-secret-name> -o yaml -n kubeslice-<projectname>
   ```
