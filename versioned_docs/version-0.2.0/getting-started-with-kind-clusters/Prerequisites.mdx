## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following environment set up that is required to install 
KubeSlice. In this environment, you must install the KubeSlice Controller and register 
clusters with it.

### Command Line Tools 
You need the following command line tools to install KubeSlice.

|  Package Required   | Installation Instructions
|---------------------|--------------------------
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/) - The Package Manager for Kubernetes | https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/ 
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) - Kubernetes CLI | https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
| [kubectx and kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) |  https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx#Installation
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) | https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
| Kind CLI | https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation


### Infrastructure Requirements
The following are the infrastructure requirements to install KubeSlice
components.

:::info
If you are on Ubuntu OS, then it is recommended to increase the `ulimit`
to 2048 or unlimited.
:::

|                                         |                           |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Host Requirements**               | Minimum of 8vCPUs and 8GB of RAM  |

:::info
Ensure to modify the memory and CPU usage allowed to docker as described in           
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/#resources. 
::: 

#### Requirements for Hosting KubeSlice Controller
   
:::info
You can install the KubeSlice Controller on a cluster and also register the same cluster 
with the KubeSlice Controller.
:::

|                                         |                           |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cluster Requirements**                |     1 Kubernetes Cluster  |  
| **Supported Kubernetes Versions**       |   [1.21](https://v1-21.docs.kubernetes.io/) and [1.22](https://v1-22.docs.kubernetes.io/) |
| **Required Helm Version**               |  3.7.0  |


#### Requirements for Worker Clusters

|                                         |                           |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Minimum Clusters Required**           | 2 Kubernetes Clusters    |
|  **Nodes Reserved for KubeSlice Components]** |   1 Node per cluster |
| **Supported Kubernetes Versions**       |   [1.21](https://v1-21.docs.kubernetes.io/) and [1.22](https://v1-22.docs.kubernetes.io/) |
| **Required Helm Version**               |  3.7.0  |

### Cluster Context Switching
You must change your `kubeconfig` context frequently to run
`kubectl `commands in each cluster. Using `kubectx` can make this
process easier and save you time.

To switch the context to a certain cluster, run the following command
with the corresponding cluster name:

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

Expected Output

```
Switched to context "<cluster name>"
```

To return to the last used context, use the following command:

```
kubectx -
```

Expected Output

```
Switched to context "<previous context>"
```
