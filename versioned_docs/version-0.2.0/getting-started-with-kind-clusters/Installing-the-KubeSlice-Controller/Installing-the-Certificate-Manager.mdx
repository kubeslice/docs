### Installing the Certificate Manager 
The KubeSlice Controller uses the certificate manager to provision the certificates for 
the webhook server. The certificate manager uses the Kubernetes API server that is 
extended using a webhook server for providing dynamic admission control over the 
certificate manager resources. This implies that the certificate manager benefits from 
the same behaviour as the basic Kubernetes resources.

Switch the context to the controller cluster using the following command: 

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```


Install the `cert-manager` using the following command:

``` 
helm install cert-manager kubeslice/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager  --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true
```
