## Installing the KubeSlice Controller 

The KubeSlice Controller orchestrates the creation and management of slices on worker 
clusters. The KubeSlice Controller components and the worker cluster components can 
coexist on a cluster. Hence, the cluster running the KubeSlice Controller can also be used 
as a worker cluster. **We recommend that you run the KubeSlice Controller on a separate
cluster**.

This following section describes the steps to install the KubeSlice Controller in a 
cluster. 

:::caution
The kind cluster deployment is only supported with a single host and it does not support 
connectivity to the cloud clusters.
:::

Installing the KubeSlice Controller on a cluster installs the following:

* KubeSlice Controller specific ClusterResourceDefinitions (CRDs)
* ClusterRole, ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding for KubeSlice Controller
* A Role and RoleBinding for KubeSlice Controller Leader Election
* KubeSlice Controller workload
* Kubernetes Dashboard
* KubeSlice Controller API Gateway

:::info
Only the cluster administrator can install the KubeSlice Controller.
