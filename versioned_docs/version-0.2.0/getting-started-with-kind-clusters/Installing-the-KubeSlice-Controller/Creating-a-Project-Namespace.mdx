### Creating a Project Namespace
A project may represent an individual customer or an organization or a
department within an organization. Each project would have a dedicated
auto-generated namespace, which will ensure that the resources of one
project do not clash with the resources of another project.

For example, a slice with the same name can exist across multiple
projects but with different configurations. Changes to the slice in one
project will not affect the slice in another project.

#### Creating a Project YAML File
Create a `project.yaml` file for the project namespace.

:::info
To understand more about the configuration parameters, see [Project
Namespace Configuration Parameters](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/configuration-parameters.mdx#project-namespace-configuration-parameters).
:::

```
apiVersion: controller.kubeslice.io/v1alpha1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: avesha
  namespace: kubeslice-controller
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    readOnly:
      - <readonly user1>
      - <readonly user2>
      - <readonly user3>
    readWrite:
      - <readwrite user1>
      - <readwrite user2>
      - <readwrite user3>
```

#### Applying the Project YAML File

Apply the project in the controller cluster by running the following
command:

```
kubectl apply -f project.yaml -n kubeslice-controller
```

#### Validating the Project

Check the project by using the following command:

```
kubectl get project -n kubeslice-controller
```

Expected Output

```
NAME     AGE
avesha   30s
```
