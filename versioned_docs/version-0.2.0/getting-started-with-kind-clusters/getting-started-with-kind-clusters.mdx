# Getting Started with Kind Clusters

## Introduction 

This guide will walk you through successfully registering your kind
clusters with the KubeSlice Controller and creating a slice across the
clusters. We have worked to make this experience as seamless as
possible. If you have any comments, questions, or issues, please feel
free to join our [community](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/community.mdx).

The following sections help you to:

-   Pre-requisites
-   Install the KubeSlice Controller on the controller cluster
-   Register the worker clusters on the controller cluster and install
    the Slice Operator (Worker Operator) on the worker clusters
-   Create a slice
-   Test the connectivity between the worker clusters using the iPerf
    tool

The following diagram shows the topology of KubeSlice installed on
kind clusters.
