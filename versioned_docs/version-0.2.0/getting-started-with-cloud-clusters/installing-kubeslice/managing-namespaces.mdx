# Managing Namespaces

## Introduction
This topic describes the steps to onboard namespaces to a slice. A namespace in Kubernetes 
is a logical separation of resources in a cluster. Kubernetes resources such as pods and 
services are associated with a namespace and are guaranteed to be uniquely identifiable 
within it. 

Namespaces that are created to run application deployments can be onboarded on a slice to 
form a micro-network segment. After a namespace is bound to a slice, all the pods that get 
scheduled in the namespace would get connected to the slice. 

## Onboarding Namespaces
To onboard namespaces, you must add them as part of applicationNamespaces in the [slice configuration](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/creating-a-slice.mdx#creating-the-slice-yaml-file) YAML file.
You can add namespaces in the following ways in the slice configuration YAML file:

- Add namespaces for each worker cluster.
- Add a wildcard * (asterisk) to add all namespaces in the worker clusters.

:::info
Ensure that the namespace that you want to onboard exists on the worker cluster.
:::

Add the namespace and the corresponding clusters under the applicationNamespaces in the slice configuration file as illustrated below.
```
namespaceIsolationProfile:
  applicationNamespaces:
   - namespace: iperf
     clusters:
      - 'worker-cluster-1'
   - namespace: bookinfo
     clusters:
      - '*'
```
:::info
Adding the asterisk (*) enables the namespace sameness, which means that the namespace 
is onboarded on all the worker clusters of that slice.
:::

To know more on parameters, see [namespace isolation profile parameters](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/configuration-parameters.mdx#namespace-isolation-profile-parameters).
This configuration ensures that all the application deployments from that namespace are 
onboarded automatically on to the slice.

## Offboarding Namespaces
You can offboard namespaces from the slice and prevent the applications on the slice 
from accessing them. To know more, see [offboarding namespaces](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/uninstalling-kubeslice/offboarding-namespaces.mdx).

## ServiceExports and ServiceImports
The Service Discovery is implemented using the CRDs ServiceExport and ServiceImport.

ServiceExport CRD is used to configure an existing service in the slice to be exposed and discovered across the
clusters in the slice. On creating a ServiceExport in a cluster, a corresponding ServiceImport is created in all
the clusters that includes the list of endpoints populated from ServiceExport. This CRD contains endpoints aggregated
from all the clusters that expose the same service. The reconciler populates the DNS entries and ensures traffic
to reach the correct clusters and endpoint.

:::info
If you want the service discoverable across the KubeSlice DNS, you must create a ServiceExport.
:::

### Creating a ServiceExport
To export a service, you must create a service export .yaml file using the following template.

:::info
To understand more about the configuration parameters, see [Service Export Configuration Parameters](/versioned_docs/version-0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/configuration-parameters.mdx#service-export-configuration-parameters).
:::
```
apiVersion:  networking.kubeslice.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: <serviceexport name>
  namespace: <application namespace>
spec:
  slice: <slice name>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      <key>: <value>
  ports:
   - name: <protocol name>
     containerPort: <port>
     protocol: <protocol>
```

### Applying the ServiceExport YAML File
To apply the service export to the service deployed in the previous section, use the following command targeting
the newly created service export .yaml file:
```
kubectl apply -f <serviceexport yaml> -n <namespace>
```

You can verify the service was exported successfully using the following command:
```
kubectl get serviceexport -n <namespace>
```

The service is exported and reachable through KubeSlice DNS as.
```
<serviceexport name>.<namespace>.<slice name>.svc.slice.local
```

:::success
You have successfully deployed and exported a service to your KubeSlice cluster.
:::

## ServiceImports
When a ServiceExport is deployed, the corresponding ServiceImport is automatically created on each of the clusters
that are part of the slice. This populates the necessary DNS entries and ensures your traffic always reaches the
correct cluster and endpoint.

You can verify that the service is imported on other clusters correctly using the following command:
```
kubectl get serviceimport -n <namespace>
```
## Limitations
:::info
Only HTTP services can be exported on a slice that is configured to use Istio gateways for ingress/egress.
Raw TCP or UDP services cannot be exported.
