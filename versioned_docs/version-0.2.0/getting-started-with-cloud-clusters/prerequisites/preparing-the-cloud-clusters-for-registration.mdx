# Preparing the Cloud Clusters for Registration

# Introduction

This topic describes how to prepare your clusters to register with KubeSlice Controller.

# Authenticating Clusters 

:::info
If you have already retrieved your credentials to log in to your clusters, continue to 
[Labeling KubeSlice Nodes](#labeling-kubeslice-gateway-nodes) below.
:::
:::info 
Perform these steps on each cluster that you want to register with the KubeSlice Controller.
:::

Before registering your clusters with KubeSlice Controller, you must authenticate with each cloud provider 
that is used in your installation. Each of the following commands retrieves the relevant `kubeconfig` and 
add it to your default `kubeconfig` path.

## Google Kubernetes Engine
The following information is required to retrieve your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<cluster name\>  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  <region\>       |  The region the cluster belongs to.|
| <project id\>    | The project ID that the cluster belongs to.|
 

The following command retrieves your GKE cluster `kubeconfig` and adds it to your default `kubeconfig` 
path. Complete this step for each GKE cluster that you want to work with.

``` 
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --region <region> --project <project id>
```

Expected Output

``` 
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for <cluster name>
```

For more information, see 
[Google Cloud CLI Docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials)

## Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service 
The following information is required to retrieve your Microsoft Azure 
Kubernetes Service (AKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**      |        **Description** |
|-----|-----|
| <resource group name\> |  The name of the resource group the cluster belongs to.
  <cluster name\>         | The name of the cluster you would like to get credentials for.|

The following command retrieves your AKS cluster `kubeconfig` and add it to your default `kubeconfig` path. 
Complete this step for each AKS cluster that you want to work with.

``` 
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource group name> --name <cluster name>
```
For more information, see 
[Microsoft AKS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-credentials)

## Labeling KubeSlice Gateway Nodes

:::caution
We recommend using a dedicated nodepool and follow the above instructions for labeling.
:::

If you have multiple node pools on your cluster, then you can add a label to each node pool. Labels are 
useful in managing scheduling rules for nodes.

:::info
If a cluster contains only one node pool, follow the instructions in 
[Labeling Individual Nodes](#labeling-individual-nodes).

Labeling gateway nodes only applies to the worker cluster.
:::

Perform these steps in each cluster that you want to register with the KubeSlice. If you have to use a 
single node pool, then perform the following steps.

## Google Kubernetes Engine
The following information is required to label the GKE cluster nodepools.

|**Variable** |       **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<nodepool name\>|   The name of the nodepool being labeled.|
|<cluster name\>  |  The name of the cluster the nodepool being labeled belongs to.|
|  <region\>      |    The Compute Engine region for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
|  <zone\>         |   The Compute Engine zone for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
 
The following command labels the GKE cluster nodepool: 

``` 
gcloud container node-pools update <nodepool name> \
    --node-labels=kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway \
    --cluster=<cluster name> \
    [--region=<region> | --zone=<zone>]
```

## Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service
AKS nodepools can only be set during nodepool creation. The nodepool
must contain the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label. For instructions on creating
a labeled nodepool, visit the [AKS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#setting-nodepool-labels).

## Labeling Individual Nodes

The following information is required to label an individual nodepool.

|**Variable**  |     **Description** |
|------|-----|
|**cluster name** |  Name of the cluster the node belongs to.|
|**node name** |     Name of the node you will be labeling (will be fetched below).

Perform these steps to label your node:

1. Switch contexts to the cluster that contains the node pool you would like to label.
   ```
   kubectx <cluster name>
   ```
    
2. Use the following command to get the `node name` and `cluster name` from the list of nodes belonging to 
the cluster you want to label:
   ``` 
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
    
3. Use the following command to label your node:
   ```
   kubectl label node <node name> kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway
   ```

## Verifying Your Labels
:::info
Perform these steps on each cluster that you want to register with the KubeSlice.
:::

Perform these steps to verify your cluster labels:

1.  To verify the label, switch to the context that you want to verify.
    
    ``` 
    kubectx <cluster name>
    ``` 
2.  Use the following command to get all nodes with the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label.
    ```
    kubectl get no -l kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway
    ```    
3.  If you successfully set your labels, you  get a list of the labeled nodes in the cluster. Use the following command to verify if
    each gateway node has an external IP address configured:
    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
  
## Adding the Helm Repository

To add the helm repository:

1. Add the helm repository information to your local system.
   ```
   helm repo add kubeslice https://kubeslice.github.io/charts/
   ```
   Expected Output
   ``` 
   "kubeslice" has been added to your repositories
   ```
2. Update the repositories on your system with the following command:
   ``` 
   helm repo update
   ```
   Expected Output
   ``` 
   Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
   ...Successfully got an update from the "kubeslice" chart repository
   Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
   ```
3. To verify the repository was added successfully, view the KubeSlice
charts using the following command:
   ``` 
   helm search repo kubeslice
   ```
   Expected Output
   ```
