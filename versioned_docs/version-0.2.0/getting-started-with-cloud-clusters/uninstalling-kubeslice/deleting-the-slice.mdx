# Deleting the Slice

## Introduction

This topic describes the steps to delete the slice(s) from your cluster. The order of
these steps is very important to ensure proper resource clean-up. Ensure that you have 
completed the tasks in the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

:::warning
Offboard all the namespaces from the slice before deleting it. To know
more, see [offboarding namespaces](offboarding-namespaces).

## Deleting the Slice 

:::warning
This step **must** be completed before uninstalling the Slice Operator. Failing to do so 
can result in slices and resources not being cleaned up properly.

Switch the context to the controller cluster.

```
kubectx <cluster name>
```

To delete an individual slice, use the following command:

```
kubectl delete sliceconfig <slice-name> -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```

To delete all the slices, use the following command:

``` 
kubectl delete sliceconfig --all -n kubeslice-<project-name>
```
