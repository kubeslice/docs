## Glossary

1. Slice Boundaries: The time required for processing depends upon the amount of data. When the amount of data
to be replicated is massive, its efficient to seperate the data into slices and process it separately.
Slice boundaries are basically resources, with instructions that maintain the slices and also manages communication
of the pods and services across clusters, edges, clouds, data centers, and so on.

2. RFC1918 network addresses: The rapid growth of Internet has led to the exhaustion of the available IPv4 addresses, as a solution subnets 
were introduced that an organisation could use internally. RFC1918 are requests for comment that defines a set of private
IPv4 addresses that are not routeable on the Internet. Any router connected to the Internet will discard packets of data
defined in the RFC1918 record.
