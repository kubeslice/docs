# kubeslice-cli Overview

## Introduction 
kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool that allows you to perform KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the work need to 
install and uninstall the workloads required to run KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator in the specified clusters. This tool registers those 
clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster, and administer slices across those clusters.

The tool takes input in the form of .yaml files that describe the membership of clusters in the multi-cluster (the `topology` yaml file) 
as well as the definition of slices across those clusters (the `slice configuration` yaml file). Given those yaml files, it simplifies installation 
of KubeSlice by performing all of the necessary configuration steps to apply the appropriate config to each cluster. You can install KubeSlice 
on your existing kind or cloud clusters. 

Alternatively, as a shortcut to create a multicluster of kind clusters to get familiar with KubeSlice, you can use the 
`kubeslice-cli install â€”profile` option. It will create a demo topology with one controller and two worker clusters.
