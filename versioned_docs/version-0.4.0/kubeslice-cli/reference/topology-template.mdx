# Topology Template

The following is a template to create a topology YAML file to install KubeSlice. This is a complete reference of 
all the possible values that can be passed in a topology file.

```
configuration: 
  cluster_configuration:
    profile: #{the KubeSlice Profile for the demo. Possible values [full-demo, minimal-demo]}
    kube_config_path: #{specify the kube config file to use for topology setup; for topology only}
    controller:
      name: #{the user defined name of the controller cluster}
      context_name: #{the name of the context to use from kubeconfig file; for topology only}
      kube_config_path: #{the path to kube config file to use for controller installation; for topology only.}
                        #{This takes precedence over configuration.cluster_configuration.kube_config_path}
      control_plane_address: #{the address of the control plane kube-apiserver. slicectl determines the address from kubeconfig}
                             #{Override this flag if the address in kubeconfig is not reachable by other clusters in topology}
      node_ip: #{the IP address of one of the node in this cluster. slicectl determines this address from kubectl get nodes}
               #{Override this flag to an address which is discoverable by other clusters in the topology}
    workers: #{specify the list of worker clusters}
    - name: #{the user defined name of the worker cluster}
      context_name: #{the name of the context to use from the kubeconfig file; for topology only}
      kube_config_path: #{the path to kube config file to use for worker installation; for topology only.}
                        #{This takes precedence over configuration.cluster_configuration.kube_config_path}
      control_plane_address: #{the address of the control plane kube-apiserver. slicectl determines the address from kubeconfig}
