# Sample Configuration File
The following is the sample configuration YAML to install KubeSlice using opensource charts:

In this demonstration, we use a controller cluster with name `controller`, as well as two worker clusters with the 
names `worker-1`and `worker-2`. Add the path to the relavant `kubeconfig` file. `kubeslice-avesha` serves as an example of a project namespace.
The defined cluster context  are `kind-contoller`, `kind-worker-1`, and `kind-worker-2`.
The opensource KubeSlice repo charts URL is `https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/`.

Create the topology YAML file using the following template:

```
configuration:
  cluster_configuration:
    kube_config_path: <path-to-the-kubeconfig-file>
    controller:
      name: controller
      context_name: kind-controller
      kube_config_path: <path-to-the-controller-kubeconfig-file>
    workers:
      - name: worker-1
        context_name: kind-worker-1
      - name: worker-2
        context_name: kind-worker-2
    kube_config_path: <path-to-the-worker-kubeconfig-file>
  kubeslice_configuration:
    project_name: kubeslice-avesha
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: kubeslice
    repo_url: https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/
    cert_manager_chart:
      chart_name: cert-manager
    controller_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-controller
    worker_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-worker
```
To install KubeSlice using the topology YAML file, use the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli --config <path-to-the-topology.yaml> install
```
