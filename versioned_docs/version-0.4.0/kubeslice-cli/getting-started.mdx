# Getting Started

## Introduction 
kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool that allows you to perform KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the process
to install and uninstall the workloads needed to run KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator in the specified clusters. 
This tool registers those clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster, and administer slices across those clusters.

The tool takes input in the form of YAML files that describe the membership of clusters in the multi-cluster (the `topology` yaml file) 
as well as the definition of slices across those clusters (the `slice configuration` yaml file). Given those yaml files, it simplifies 
installation of KubeSlice by performing all of the necessary configuration steps to apply the appropriate config to each cluster. 
You can install KubeSlice on your existing kind or cloud clusters. 

Alternatively, as a shortcut to create a multicluster of kind clusters to get familiar with KubeSlice, you can use the 
`kubeslice-cli install —profile` option. It will create a demo topology with one controller and two worker clusters.


## Installing kubeslice-cli Tool

```

Example
```
sudo curl -fL https://github.com/kubeslice/kubeslice-cli/releases/download/0.3.2/kubeslice-cli-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/kubeslice-cli
```
Make the binary executable using the following command:
```
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/kubeslice-cli
```
Ensure the downloaded version is up-to-date using the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli -v
```

## kubeslice-cli Commands
# kubeslice-cli Commands

This section contains information about KubeSlice commands, syntax, options, a resource type, and a few examples of command usage.

## Syntax
Use the following syntax to run the kubeslice-cli tool:

```
kubeslice-cli [global-options] <command> [<command-arguments>] [command-options]
```

## Commands

The following table describes the syntax and descriptions for all the `kubeslice-cli` commands.

|Operations|Syntax|Description|
|----|----|---|
| create | `kubeslice-cli create [options]` | Creates one or more resources from a file. |
| delete | `kubeslice-cli delete [options]` | Delete resources from a file.|
| describe | `kubeslice-cli describe [options]` | Describe the KubeSlice resources.|
| edit | `kubeslice-cli edit [options]` | Edit and update the definition of one or more kubeSlice resources.|
| get | `kubeslice-cli get [options]` | List one or more kubeSlice resources.|
| install | `kubeslice-cli install [options]` | Install kubeSlice resources.|
| uninstall | `kubeslice-cli uninstall [options]` | Uninstall kubeSlice resources.|
| help | `kubeslice-cli help` | Get more information on any command.|

## Options
The following are the kubeslice-cli options.

|Options|Shorthand|Description|
|----|----|----|
|--help|-h|It provides more information on the kubeslice-cli.|
|--config|-c| It is a **global** option. The path to the topology configuration YAML file.|
|--version|-v|It is the version of the `kubeslice-cli` tool.|

:::note
The kubeslice-cli tool must have access to the clusters you want it to manage. To grant it access, set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to 
a path to the kubeconfig file containing the necessary keys to access those clusters.
To set the KUBECONFIG environment varible, use these commands:
  - On Linux/macOS: `export KUBECONFIG=<path to kubeconfig file>`
  - On Windows: `set KUBECONFIG=<path to kubeconfig file>`
::: 

:::caution
- If the global **—config** option is not specified, kubeslice-cli attempts to execute against the current cluster context. Run the 
following command to determine which context you are currently in: `kubectx -c`.
- The currently supported operations are all controller cluster specific. You must run the kubeslice-cli commands on the controller cluster. 
use this command to switch the cluster context: `kubectx <controller-cluster>`.
