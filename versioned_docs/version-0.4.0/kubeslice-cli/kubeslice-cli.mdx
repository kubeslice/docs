# kubeslice-cli
kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool that allows you to perform KubeSlice operations on 
Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the process to install and uninstall the workloads 
needed to run KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator in the specified clusters.
This tool registers those clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster, and 
administer slices across those clusters.
