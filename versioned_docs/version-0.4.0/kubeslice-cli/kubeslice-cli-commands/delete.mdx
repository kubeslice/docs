# delete

Use this command to delete the KubeSlice resources. For example, use the delete command to  delete a slice, project, or 
service export. The delete command can also be used to unregister the registered worker cluster. 
You must offboard the namespaces and delete the slice before unregistering the worker cluster. For more information, 
see [Uninstalling KubeSlice](/versioned_docs/version-0.x.0/kubeslice-cli/uninstalling-kubeslice.mdx).
