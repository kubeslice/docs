:::note
The kubeslice-cli tool must have access to the clusters you want it to manage. To grant it access, set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to 
a path to the kubeconfig file containing the necessary keys to access those clusters.
To set the KUBECONFIG environment varible, use these commands:
  - On Linux/macOS: `export KUBECONFIG=<path to kubeconfig file>`
  - On Windows: `set KUBECONFIG=<path to kubeconfig file>`
::: 

:::caution
- If the global **â€”config** option is not specified, kubeslice-cli attempts to execute against the current cluster context. Run the 
following command to determine which context you are currently in: `kubectx -c`.
- The currently supported operations are all controller cluster specific. You must run the kubeslice-cli commands on the controller cluster. 
use this command to switch the cluster context: `kubectx <controller-cluster>`.
