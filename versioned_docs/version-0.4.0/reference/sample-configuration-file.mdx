# Sample Configuration File

This topic describes how to create a topology configuration file that is used to install KubeSlice. In the topology configuration file,
specify the controller cluster and the worker clusters names and other details as described in the below sample configuration file.

## Create a Topology Configuration File for Kind Clusters
The following is the sample configuration file to install KubeSlice on kind clusters using opensource charts:

In this demonstration, we use a controller cluster with name `controller`, as well as two worker clusters with the 
names `worker-1`and `worker-2`. Add the path to the relevant `kubeconfig` file. `kubeslice-avesha` serves as an example of a 
project namespace. The defined cluster context  are `kind-controller`, `kind-worker-1`, and `kind-worker-2`. The opensource 
KubeSlice repo charts URL is `https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/`.

Create the topology configuration file using the following template:
:::info
For more information on topology configuration parameters, 
see [kubeslice-cli Configuration Parameters](/versioned_docs/version-0.4.0/reference/kubeslice-cli-configuration-parameters.mdx).
:::

```yaml
configuration:
  cluster_configuration:
    kube_config_path: <path-to-the-kubeconfig-file>
    controller:
      name: controller
      context_name: kind-controller
      kube_config_path: <path-to-the-controller-kubeconfig-file>
    workers:
      - name: worker-1
        context_name: kind-worker-1
      - name: worker-2
        context_name: kind-worker-2
    kube_config_path: <path-to-the-worker-kubeconfig-file>
  kubeslice_configuration:
    project_name: kubeslice-avesha
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: kubeslice
    repo_url: https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/
    cert_manager_chart:
      chart_name: cert-manager
    controller_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-controller
    worker_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-worker
```


## Create a Topology Configuration File for Cloud Clusters

The following is the sample configuration YAML to install KubeSlice on cloud clusters using opensource charts.

In this demonstration, we use a controller cluster with name `controller`, as well as two worker clusters with the names `worker-1` 
and `worker-2`. Add the path to the relevant `kubeconfig` file. `avesha` serves as an example of a project namespace. The defined 
cluster context  are `controller`, `worker-1`, and `worker-2`. The opensource KubeSlice repo charts 
URL is `https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/`.

Create the topology YAML file using the following template:

  kubeslice_configuration:

## Apply the Topology Configuration YAML
To install KubeSlice using the topology YAML file, use the following command:
```
kubeslice-cli --config <path-to-the-topology.yaml> install
```
