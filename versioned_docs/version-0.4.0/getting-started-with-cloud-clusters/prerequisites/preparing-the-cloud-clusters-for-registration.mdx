# Prepare Clusters 

## Introduction
This topic describes how to prepare your kind clusters to register with KubeSlice Controller.

## Prepare Kind Clusters
If you want to configure KubeSlice on kind clusters with kubeslice-cli, then using the `minimal-demo` or 
`full-demo` option creates kind clusters for you. 

If you want to configure KubeSlice on kind clusters with YAML, then you must prepare them for registration 
as described in [prepare to register kind clusters](/versioned_docs/version-0.4.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/prerequisites/prepare-to-register.mdx).

## Prepare Cloud Clusters for Registration
You must prepare cloud clusters for registration as described in the following sections. 

### Authenticate Clusters 

:::info
If you have already retrieved your credentials to log in to your clusters, continue to 
[Label KubeSlice Nodes](#label-kubeslice-gateway-nodes) below.
:::
:::info 
Perform these steps on each cluster that you want to register with the KubeSlice Controller.
:::

Before registering your clusters with KubeSlice Controller, you must authenticate with each cloud provider 
that is used in your installation. Each of the following commands retrieves the relevant `kubeconfig` and 
add it to your default `kubeconfig` path.

### Azure Kubernetes Service 
For information on prerequisites and authentication, see [Microsoft AKS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-credentials).
The following information is required to retrieve your Microsoft Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**      |        **Description** |
|-----|-----|
| <resource group name\> |  The name of the resource group the cluster belongs to.
  <cluster name\>         | The name of the cluster you would like to get credentials for.|

The following command retrieves your AKS cluster `kubeconfig` and add it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each
AKS cluster that you want to work with.

``` 
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource group name> --name <cluster name>
```

### Elastic Kubernetes Service 
For information on prerequisites and other required details, see the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

The following information is required to retrieve your Elastic Kubernetes
Service (EKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<cluster name\>  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  <cluster region\>       |  The AWS region the cluster belongs to.|

The following command retrieves your EKS cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each EKS
cluster that you want to work with.

``` 
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <cluster-region>  
```

### Google Kubernetes Engine
For information on the prerequisites and other required details, see [Google Cloud CLI Docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials).

The following information is required to retrieve your Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<cluster name\>  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  <region\>       |  The region the cluster belongs to.|
| <project id\>    | The project ID that the cluster belongs to.|
 

The following command retrieves your GKE cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each GKE
cluster that you want to work with.

``` 
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --region <region> --project <project id>
```

Expected Output

``` 
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for <cluster name>
```

### Label KubeSlice Gateway Nodes

:::info
Labeling gateway nodes only applies to the worker cluster.
:::

:::caution
We recommend using a dedicated nodepool and follow the above instructions for labeling.
:::

If you have multiple node pools on your worker cluster, then you can add a
label to each node pool. Labels are useful in managing scheduling rules
for nodes.

Perform these steps in each worker cluster that you want to register with 
the KubeSlice Controller. If you have to use a single node pool, then perform the
following steps.

#### Azure Kubernetes Service
AKS nodepools can only be set during nodepool creation. The nodepool
must contain the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label. For instructions on creating
a labeled nodepool, visit the [AKS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#setting-nodepool-labels).

#### Elastic Kubernetes Service  
Nodepools are called node groups in EKS clusters. The node group must contain 
the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label. You can add or remove the Kubernetes 
labels by editing a node group configuration as described in 
[updating managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html).

#### Google Kubernetes Engine
The following information is required to label the GKE cluster nodepools.

|**Variable** |       **Description** |
|-----|----|
|<nodepool name\>|   The name of the nodepool being labeled.|
|<cluster name\>  |  The name of the cluster the nodepool being labeled belongs to.|
|  <region\>      |    The Compute Engine region for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
|  <zone\>         |   The Compute Engine zone for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
 
The following command labels the GKE cluster nodepool: 

``` 
gcloud container node-pools update <nodepool name> \
    --node-labels=kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway \
    --cluster=<cluster name> \
    [--region=<region> | --zone=<zone>]
```

### Verify Your Labels
:::info
Perform these steps on each cluster that you want to register with the KubeSlice.
:::

Perform these steps to verify your cluster labels:

1.  To verify the label, switch to the context that you want to verify.
    
    ``` 
    kubectx <cluster name>
    ``` 
2.  Use the following command to get all nodes with the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label.
    ```
    kubectl get no -l kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway
    ```    
3.  If you successfully set your labels, you  get a list of the labeled nodes in the cluster. Use the following command to verify if
    each gateway node has an external IP address configured:
    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
  
## Add the Helm Repository

:::info
For configuring KubeSlice on kind clusters with YAML, you must [prepare them for registration](/versioned_docs/version-0.4.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/prerequisites/prepare-to-register.mdx). 
:::

To add the helm repository:

1. Add the helm repository information to your local system.
   ```
   helm repo add kubeslice https://kubeslice.github.io/kubeslice/
   ```
   Expected Output
   ``` 
   "kubeslice" has been added to your repositories
   ```
2. Update the repositories on your system with the following command:
   ``` 
   helm repo update
   ```
   Expected Output
   ``` 
   Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
   ...Successfully got an update from the "kubeslice" chart repository
   Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
   ```
3. To verify the repository was added successfully, view the KubeSlice
charts using the following command:
   ``` 
   helm search repo kubeslice
   ```
   Expected Output
   ```
