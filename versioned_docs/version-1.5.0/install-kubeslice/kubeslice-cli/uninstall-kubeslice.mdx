:::info
The order of operations in uninstalling the KubeSlice Controller is important to ensure all resources are cleaned up properly. Follow the 
order of operations provided under this topic.
:::

## Offboard Namespaces
To offboard the namespaces from slice, you must first delete the serviceexport for each application. For more information, see 
[offboard Namespaces](/versioned_docs/version-1.4.0/uninstall-kubeslice/uninstall-kubeslice.mdx#offboard-application-namespaces).

 
## Delete a Slice
Before deleting the slice, you must offboard all namespaces. Failure to do so may result in slices and resources not being properly cleaned up.

Use the following command to delete the slice:
```
kubeslice-cli delete sliceConfig <sliceConfig-name> -n <project namespace>
```
   
## Deregister the Worker Cluster
:::caution
Before deregistering the worker cluster, ensure you have offboarded all namespaces and deleted the slice.
::: 

You must first uninstall the Slice Operator from the worker cluster before deregistering it from the KubeSlice Controller. To uninstall
the Slice Operator, follow the instructions in the [uninstall the Slice Operator](/versioned_docs/version-1.4.0/uninstall-kubeslice/uninstall-kubeslice.mdx#uninstall-the-slice-operator) 
section.

Use the following command to delete a registered worker cluster:
```
kubeslice-cli delete worker <worker-name> -n <project-namespace>
```

## Delete a Project
:::caution
Before deleting a project, ensure all namespaces have been offboarded and the slice has been deleted.
:::

Delete a project after deregistering the worker cluster. The service account, namespaces, clusters, secrets, certificates, and tokens 
are all deleted when the project is deleted from the KubeSlice Controller.
   
Use the following command to delete the project:
```
kubeslice-cli delete project <project-name> -n <controller-namespace>
```

## Uninstall the KubeSlice Controller
:::caution
Before deleting a project, ensure all namespaces have been offboarded, the slice(s) have been deleted, and the worker cluster has been deregistered.
:::
  
After deleting all the projects, uninstall the KubeSlice Controller. To uninstall the KubeSlice Controller, see
[uninstall the KubeSlice Controller](/versioned_docs/version-1.4.0/uninstall-kubeslice/uninstall-kubeslice.mdx#uninstall-the-kubeslice-controller).
