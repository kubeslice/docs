# Controller Events
The KubeSlice Controller generates events that represent an operation on the controller
cluster. All of these generated events are specific to KubeSlice operations.

By default,the KubeSlice Controller logs the events in the following namespaces:

- [kubeslice-controller](#kubeslice-controller-namespace-events)
- [kubeslice-project](#kubeslice-project-namespace-events)

## kubeslice-controller Namespace Events
This section describes the events that are generated on the `kubeslice-controller` namespace.
Use the following command to get the `kubeslice-controller` namespace events:

```
kubectl get events -n kubeslice-controller
```

These events are related to the worker objects of a slice. A worker object is automatically generated after slice creation.
A worker object is created for every worker cluster connected to a slice.

### WorkerSliceGateway
These events are related to the worker slice gateways for a slice with more than one worker cluster. The number
of worker slice gateways on a slice is equal to `n * (n-1)`, where `n` is the total number of worker
clusters on that slice.

### WorkerSliceRoleBinding
These events are related to the worker objects of the slice role assignment. A worker object is 
automatically generated after the slice role assignment.

## Disable the KubeSlice Controller Events
You can disable all the KubeSlice Controller events or a few of them. 

### Disable All the KubeSlice Controller Events 
If you want to disable all the events, then edit the KubeSlice Controller configuration 
file and set the following configuration for `events`. 

```
  events:
    disabled: true
```
After changing the configuration, use the following command to update the KubeSlice Controller: 

```
helm upgrade kubeslice-controller kubeslice/kubeslice-controller -f <full path of the values.yaml> -n kubeslice-controller
```

Where `values.yaml` is the KubeSlice Controller configuration file. 

### Disable a Few KubeSlice Controller Events
If you do not want to see a KubeSlice Controller event, then you can list it under `disabledEvents` in
the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file that is located in the `kubeslice-controller`
namespace.

For example, if you do not want to see the `WorkerSliceConfigCreated` event, then go to
the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file using the following command:

```
kubectl edit cm kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf -n kubeslice-controller
```

In the `kubeslice-controller-event-schema-conf` file, add the `WorkerSliceConfigCreated` event that you want
to hide under `disabledEvents` as illustrated below.

```
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
