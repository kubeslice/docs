# Controller Metrics
The KubeSlice Controller metrics provide insights into the operations and events performed 
by the controller for various components. The `kubeslice_controller_events_counter` metric 
is a counter that tracks the count of events raised for a specific action on an object. Each 
component has its own set of labels, allowing you to distinguish and analyze metrics based on 
the corresponding component. These labels include the slice name, project, cluster, namespace, 
reporting controller, action, event, object name, and object kind. By monitoring these metrics, 
you can gain visibility into the events and actions performed by the KubeSlice Controller, 
enabling you to track resource quotas and effectively manage your KubeSlice deployments.

The metric below is common for all the components, which is distinguished by the corresponding label for each component.

| Sl. No | Name                                | Type    | Labels                                                                                                                         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | kubeslice_controller_events_counter | Counter | slice_name, slice_project, slice_cluster, slice_namespace, slice_reporting_controller, action, event, object_name, object_kind | This metric provides the count of all the events raised for a particular action in an object. |


## Labels
The following table describes the labels that are attached to the KubeSlice Controller metrics.

| Label                      | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| action                     | The action which triggered the metric record.                                                                                |
| event                      | The event title to which the metric is attached to.                                                                          |
| object_kind                | The kind of the object on which the metric is recorded.                                                                      |
| object_name                | The name of the object on which the metric is recorded.                                                                      |
| slice_cluster              | The name of the cluster the metric is attached to. The value is controller for all the KubeSlice Controller related metrics. |
| slice_name                 | The name of the slice which the metric is attached to. The value is `NA` if the metric is unrelated to any slice.            |
| slice_namespace            | The namespace of the object for which the metric is recorded.                                                                |
| slice_project              | The name of the project on which the slice is created.                                                                       |
| slice_reporting_controller | The name of the reporting controller. The value is `controller` for all the KubeSlice Controller related metrics.            |
