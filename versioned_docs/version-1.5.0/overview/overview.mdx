# What is KubeSlice?
Managing large-scale applications and infrastructure can be a daunting task in the enterprise 
world. With Kubernetes, orchestrating applications became simpler, but orchestrating and 
scaling your microservices based applications has become more difficult as you grow from 
single cluster to multi-cluster deployments.

KubeSlice offers a simpler solution to the complex challenges of running multi-cluster 
applications at scale by creating a Kubernetes construct called Slice. The slice creates a 
specific overlay network  across a fleet of clusters that serves as a logical 
application boundary, enabling pods and services to communicate with each other seamlessly. 
The slice transcends geographic borders, allowing applications to be deployed anywhere, 
whether on any cluster, cloud, edge, or Kubernetes distribution.

Moreover, KubeSlice offers NIST-compliant VPN tunnels for secure and low-latency inter-cluster 
networking via the east/west path. The slice serves as a single security domain across 
multi-cluster and multiple cloud providers. 

## Why KubeSlice?
As enterprises expand application architectures to span multiple clusters located in data centers or cloud 
provider regions, or across cloud providers, Kubernetes clusters need the ability to fully integrate 
connectivity and pod-to-pod communications with namespace propagation across clusters.

KubeSlice enables creating multiple logical slices in a single cluster or group of clusters regardless of 
their physical location.  Existing intra-cluster communication remains local to the cluster utilizing each 
pod's CNI interface. KubeSlice provides isolation of network traffic between clusters by creating an overlay 
network for inter-cluster communication.

KubeSlice accomplishes this by adding a second interface to the pod allowing local traffic to remain on the 
CNI interface, and traffic bound for external clusters route over the overlay network to its destination pod 
making KubeSlice CNI agnostic. 

KubeSlice solves the complex problem of overlapping IP addressing between cloud providers, data centers, and 
edge locations. The overlay network is configured with a non-overlapping RFC1918 private network CIDR address 
space. As KubeSlice creates network isolation, KubeSlice also takes the responsibility of allocating subnets 
that are configurable based on the number of pods allocated to have inter-cluster reachability. In addition, 
the same RFC1918 address can be configured across multiple slices created on the same cluster or cluster sets 
further simplifying IP address management.

KubeSlice offers services that dramatically increase application velocity for platform and product teams to 
achieve uniformity for applications in multi-cluster environments.
