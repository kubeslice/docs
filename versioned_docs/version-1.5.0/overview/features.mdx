# Key Features

KubeSlice makes Kubernetes simple at scale for multi cluster/multi-tenant/
multi-region/multi-cloud application deployments. It is a platform that combines
network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services to bring uniformity
across clusters for multi-cluster applications, thus dramatically increasing
development velocity for platform and product teams. 

KubeSlice bundles the following services into its architecture:

## IP Address Management

IP Address Management (IPAM) is a method of planning, tracking, and managing the IP address space
used in a network. On the KubeSlice Manager, the **Maximum Clusters** parameter of the slice creation
page helps with IPAM. The corresponding YAML parameter is `maxClusters`.

This parameter sets the maximum number of worker clusters that you can connect to a slice. The
maximum number of worker clusters affects the subnet calculation of a worker cluster. The subnet
in turn determines the number of host addresses a worker cluster gets for its application pods.

For example, if the slice subnet is 10.1.0.0/16 and the maximum number of clusters is 16, then each
cluster gets a subnet of 10.1.x.0/20, where x = 0, 16, or 32.

This is a significant parameter that can only be configured during slice creation. If this parameter is
not set, it defaults to 16.

:::caution
The subnet of a worker cluster determines the number of host addresses that are available to that
cluster. Hence, you must be prudent and cautious when you set the maximum worker clusters. The value
of the maximum number of clusters set remains constant for the entire life of a slice, and it is
immutable after a slice is created.
:::

The fewer the clusters, the more IP addresses are available for the application pods
of every worker cluster that is part of a slice. By default, the value of the **Maximum Clusters**
parameter is 16. The supported value range is 2 to 32 clusters.

### Dynamic IPAM 
KubeSlice supports dynamic IP Address Management (IPAM) for efficient utilization of IP address space across multiple clusters. 
With dynamic IPAM, subnets are allocated on-demand when clusters join a slice, rather than being pre-allocated during slice creation.
This approach optimizes IP address usage and simplifies network management in multi-cluster environments.

KubeSlice offers two IPAM modes:

- **Static IPAM**: Pre-allocates all 256 subnets at the time of slice creation, resulting in significant inefficiency.
- **Dynamic IPAM**: Allocates subnets only when clusters join the slice, achieving near 0% IP waste and ensuring optimal utilization of 
                    the IP pool. Dynamic IPAM eliminates IP address waste while preserving full backward compatibility for existing 
                    Static IPAM–based slices.
                
:::info 
KubeSlice uses Static IPAM by default. You must set the `sliceIPAMType` parameter to `Dynamic` in the slice 
configuration to use the dynamic IPAM feature.

## Connectivity to Clusters in Private VPCs

In addition to connecting public clusters, KubeSlice can also be used to connect clusters that are enclosed within a private VPC. 
Such clusters are accessed through network or application Load Balancer that are provisioned and managed by the cloud provider. 
KubeSlice relies on network Load Balancers to setup the inter-cluster connectivity to private clusters.

The following picture illustrates the inter-cluster connectivity set up by KubeSlice using a network Load Balancer (LB).

![loadbalancer](/images/version1.3.0/key-features/support-for-private-clusters.png)

Users can specify the type of connectivity for a cluster. If the cluster is in a private VPC, the user can utilize the `LoadBalancer` 
connectivity type to connect it to other clusters. The default value is `NodePort`. The user can also configure the gateway protocol 
while configuring the gateway type. The value can be TCP or UDP. The default value is UDP.
