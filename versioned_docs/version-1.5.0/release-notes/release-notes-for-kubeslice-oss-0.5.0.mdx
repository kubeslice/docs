# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.5.0

*Release date: 29th December 2022*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Network Service Mesh Upgrade 
The Network Service Mesh (NSM) component has been upgraded to the stable 
[GA version 1.5.0](https://networkservicemesh.io/docs/releases/v1.5.0/) that provides upstream networking fixes. 

### Latest Supported Kubernetes Version 
The latest Kubernetes version that we support from this release is version [1.24](https://v1-24.docs.kubernetes.io/). 

### Enhancements 
* When the **namespace sameness** is applied to a namespace on a slice, then it applies to all worker 
  clusters that are part of the slice. If a worker cluster does not already have that namespace, it is now created. This 
  ensures that all the worker clusters that are part of a slice will have that 
  namespace for which the namespace sameness is applied. This created namespace remains on the worker 
  cluster even after the worker cluster is detached from that slice, and even when that slice is deleted.

## Known Issues
The known issues are as follows:

- If the SPIRE server takes time to start up, the **spire-server** pod continues to restart, thus delaying the completion 
of cluster registration by 120 seconds. The worker cluster can only be added to a slice after this.
  
  Workaround: None

- After a slice is created, the gateway connectivity takes approximately 120 seconds to establish a tunnel.
 
  Workaround: None

- Istio version 1.13 is incompatible with Kubernetes version 1.24. It might cause issues with KubeSlice version 0.5.0, which 
  now supports Kubernetes version 1.24. However, KubeSlice version 0.5.0 can be installed without Istio too.
  
  Workaround: In the following topics, you must skip the steps related to Istio:
