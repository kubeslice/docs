# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.2.1

*Release date: 13th Mar 2024*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New :speaker:
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.


### Controller Module Version Upgrade 
We have upgraded the controller-runtime module to the latest version 0.16 from version 0.11 to 
enable future development of new reconcilers.

### Cluster Slice Connectivity 
We have created pod disruption budget to prevent connectivity loss between clusters of a slice 
during disruptions. At least one pair of slice gateway pods should be present between a pair of 
clusters.

## Issues fixed :wrench:
* The webhook error that occurred during an application deployment on a slice is fixed.
