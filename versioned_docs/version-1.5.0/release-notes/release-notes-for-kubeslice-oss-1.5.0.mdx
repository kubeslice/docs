# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.5.0

*Release date: 19th Apr 2025*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New :speaker:
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

* KubeSlice now supports multi-architecture Docker images for both amd64 and arm64, enabling seamless 
  deployment on a wider range of systems, including:
  - Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs
  - ARM-based cloud environments (For example, AWS Graviton, and Raspberry Pi)
  - Edge devices and other low-power platforms

  Benefits:
  - One image for multiple architectures eliminates the need for separate builds
  - Optimized performance and lower power consumption on ARM devices
  - Better support for local development on Apple M-series Macs
  - Broader compatibility for cloud-native and edge deployments

* The KubeSlice Controller Helm chart now supports labeling or annotation of user-defined namespaces.
