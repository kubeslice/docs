# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.5.0

*Release date: 30th Nov 2025*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice.
