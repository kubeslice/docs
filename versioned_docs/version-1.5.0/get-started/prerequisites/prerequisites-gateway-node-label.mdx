# Label KubeSlice Gateway Nodes
Labeling your gateway nodes on the **worker cluster** is required to ensure proper management 
of scheduling rules for nodes and enabling node gateway to gateway network communication. 

We recommend using a **dedicated node pool** for your gateway components.

However, if your worker cluster contains only one node pool, follow the instructions below to 
label worker node pools.

Additionally, we recommend using a dedicated node pool for your gateway components and 
following the instructions for labeling accordingly.

Perform these steps in each worker cluster that you want to register with 
the KubeSlice Controller.

### Azure Kubernetes Service
AKS nodepools can only be set during nodepool creation. The nodepool
must contain the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label. For instructions on creating
a labeled nodepool, see [AKS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#setting-nodepool-labels).

## AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service 
Nodepools are called node groups in EKS clusters. You can add or remove the Kubernetes 
labels by editing a node group configuration as described in 
[updating managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-managed-node-group.html). 
Add the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label to the EKS node groups.

## Google Kubernetes Engine
The following information is required to label the GKE cluster nodepools.

|**Variable** |       **Description** |
|-----|----|
|`<nodepool name>`|   The name of the nodepool being labeled.|
|`<cluster name>`  |  The name of the cluster the nodepool being labeled belongs to.|
|  `<region>`      |    The Compute Engine region for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
|  `<zone>`         |   The Compute Engine zone for the cluster the nodepool belongs to.|
 
The following command labels the GKE cluster nodepool: 

``` 
gcloud container node-pools update <nodepool name> \
    --node-labels=kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway \
    --cluster=<cluster name> \
    [--region=<region> | --zone=<zone>]
```
## Other Kubernetes Cloud Clusters 
Ensure that the nodepools on the Kubernetes clusters are labeled with `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway`. 

## Verify Your Labels
To verify the labels of your cluster, perform the following steps on each worker cluster that you wish to register with the KubeSlice Controller.

1.  To verify the label, switch to the context of the cluster that you want to verify.
    
    ``` 
    kubectx <cluster name>
    ```
    
2.  Run the following command to get all nodes with the `kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway` label.

    ```
    kubectl get no -l kubeslice.io/node-type=gateway
    ```
    
3.  If you successfully set your labels, you  get a list of the labeled nodes in the cluster. 
<!--  Is this necessary right here?  Does the gateway REQUIRE an EXTERNAL IP?
Run the following command to verify if each gateway node has an external IP address configured:

    ```
    kubectl get no -o wide
    ```
