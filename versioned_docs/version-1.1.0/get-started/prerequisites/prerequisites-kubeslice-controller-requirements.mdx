| **Cluster Requirements**          | 1 Kubernetes Cluster                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Node Requirements**             | KubeSlice needs at least two nodes each with a minimum of 4 vCPUs and 16GB of RAM. We highly recommend creating a separate NodePool for KubeSlice components to improve performance and simplify management. |
| **Supported Kubernetes Versions** | [1.26](https://v1-26.docs.kubernetes.io/) and [1.27](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/supported-doc-versions/)                                                                                                                    |

## Kind Clusters 
The following are the infrastructure requirements to install KubeSlice
components.

:::info
If you are on Ubuntu OS, then it is recommended to increase the `ulimit`
to 2048 or unlimited.

If you still face issues, see [errors due to too many open files](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files).

|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Host Requirements**               | Minimum of 8vCPUs and 8GB of RAM  |

:::info
Ensure to modify the memory and CPU usage allowed to docker as described in           
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/#resources. 
::: 

:::info
KubeSlice has been tested on AKS, GKE, and EKS, but it should run in any Kubernetes
environment with the supported Kubernetes versions.
:::

:::info
In an intra-slice scenario, a single cluster can serve as both a controller cluster and a 
worker cluster. This allows KubeSlice to segment the cluster into application slices. This 
enables you to better manage and isolate your applications, improving the overall efficiency 
and performance of your cluster.
