# Cluster Authentication 
Before registering each worker cluster with the KubeSlice Controller, you must 
authenticate with each cloud provider used in the installation.

To register your worker clusters with the KubeSlice Controller, it is 
necessary to authenticate with each cloud provider used in the installation. 
To accomplish this, run the commands below to retrieve the relevant kubeconfig file 
and add it to your default kubeconfig path.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 
For information on prerequisites and authentication, see [Microsoft AKS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-credentials).
The following information is required to retrieve your Microsoft Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**      |        **Description** |
|-----|-----|
| `<resource group name>` |  The name of the resource group the cluster belongs to.
  `<cluster name>`         | The name of the cluster you would like to get credentials for.|

The following command retrieves your AKS cluster `kubeconfig` and add it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each
AKS cluster in the configuration.

``` 
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource group name> --name <cluster name>
```

## AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
For information on prerequisites and other required details, see the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

The following information is required to retrieve your Elastic Kubernetes
Service (EKS) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|`<cluster name>`  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  `<cluster region>`       |  The AWS region the cluster belongs to.|

 
The following command retrieves your EKS cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each EKS
cluster in the configuration.

``` 
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <cluster-region>  
```

## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
For information on the prerequisites and other required details, see [Google Cloud CLI Docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials).

The following information is required to retrieve your Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) `kubeconfig`.

| **Variable**  |     **Description** |
|-----|----|
|`<cluster name>`  | The name of the cluster you want to get credentials for.|
|  `<region>`       |  The region the cluster belongs to.|
| `<project id>`    | The project ID that the cluster belongs to.|
 

The following command retrieves your GKE cluster `kubeconfig` and adds
it to your default `kubeconfig` path. Complete this step for each GKE
cluster in the configuration.

``` 
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --region <region> --project <project id>
```

Expected Output

``` 
Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for <cluster name>
```

## Kind Clusters Authentication
Using the kubeslice cli's `minimal-demo` or `full-demo` option creates kind clusters for you. 
To use a new topology file for kubeslice-cli or configure KubeSlice with YAML, you must 
prepare the kind clusters as described below. 

### Prepare the Controller Cluster for Registration
Create a YAML file to prepare the controller cluster for registration by using the 
following template:

:::info
The `networking` property is required for the namespace isolation
feature. By default, the kind cluster has the kindnet CNI setting, but it needs to be 
disabled for the namespace isolation feature to work. We install Calico instead for the
CNI network.
:::

:::info
To understand more about the configuration parameters, see
[kind - Configuration](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/).
:::

:::caution
If you face memory issues with a **two-nodes** kind cluster, then use a
**single-node** kind cluster.
:::

```
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
networking:
  # WARNING: It is _strongly_ recommended that you keep this the default
  # (127.0.0.1) for security reasons. However it is possible to change this.
  apiServerAddress: "127.0.0.1"
  # By default the API server listens on a random open port.
  # You may choose a specific port but probably don't need to in most cases.
  # Using a random port makes it easier to spin up multiple clusters.
  apiServerPort: 6443
  # By default kind takes kindnet CNI but we are disabling this to use netpol feature
  disableDefaultCNI: true # disable kindnet

```

 Use the following template to create a single-node controller cluster. 

 ```
 kind: Cluster

 ```

### Apply the YAML File to Create the Controller Cluster 
Apply the YAML File to  create the controller cluster by running this command:

```
kind create cluster --name <Controller-Cluster-Name> --config kind-controller-cluster.yaml
```


### Prepare the Worker Cluster 
Create a YAML file to prepare the worker cluster for registration by using the 
following template:

:::info

```

### Apply the YAML File to Create the Worker Cluster
Apply the YAML File to create the worker cluster by running this
command:

**For worker cluster 1**

``` 
kind create cluster --name <Worker-Cluster-Name-1> --config kind-Worker-cluster.yaml
```

**For worker cluster 2**

```
kind create cluster --name <Worker-Cluster-Name-2> --config kind-Worker-cluster.yaml
```

### Install Calico Networking and Network Security
Install
[Calico](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/about/about-calico) to provide networking and
network security for kind clusters.

:::info
Install Calico only after creating the clusters.
:::

To install Calico on a kind cluster:
1. Install the operator on your cluster by using the following command:

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.24.1/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
```

2. Download the custom resources required to configure Calico by using
the following command:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.24.1/manifests/custom-resources.yaml -O
```

Running the above command downloads a file, which contains the following
content.

```
# This section includes base Calico installation configuration.
# For more information, see: https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/v3.23/reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.Installation
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  # Configures Calico networking.
  calicoNetwork:
    # Note: The ipPools section cannot be modified post-install.
    ipPools:
    - blockSize: 26
      cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
      encapsulation: VXLANCrossSubnet
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      nodeSelector: all()

# This section configures the Calico API server.
# For more information, see: https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/v3.23/reference/installation/api#operator.tigera.io/v1.APIServer
apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
  name: default
spec: {}
```

3. Create the manifest to install Calico by using the following
command:

```
kubectl create -f custom-resources.yaml
```

4. Validate namespaces related to Calico by using the following
command:

```
kubectl get ns
```

Expected Output

```
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
calico-apiserver       Active   3d
calico-system          Active   3d
default                Active   3d
kube-node-lease        Active   3d

kube-system            Active   3d
local-path-storage     Active   3d
tigera-operator        Active   3d
```

5. Validate the Calico pods by using the following command: 

```
kubectl get pods -n calico-system
```

Expected Output

```
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
