# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.1.0

*Release date: 28th July 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.


## New features

### Slice VPN Key rotation

The slice VPN Gateway is an essential component of the slice network service, allowing the slice to connect to secure VPN networks. 
By default, any new slice created using the KubeSlice Manager or the YAML file will have a duration of 30 days to renew the SliceGateway 
certificates. You can customize the rotation interval when creating a slice by setting the rotationInterval parameter in the slice 
configuration YAML file. This interval range is 30 to 90 days.

Additionally, if you need to update the rotation interval at any time, you can modify the rotationInterval parameter in the slice 
configuration file. This flexibility allows you to align the certificate renewal process with your specific security requirements. 
Moreover, if you want to initiate the certificate renewal process immediately, you can use the renewBefore option. This option allows 
you to trigger the certificate renewal process before the expiration of the rotation interval. By specifying an appropriate value for 
renewBefore parameter in the YAML file, you can ensure that the certificate renewal process starts promptly, helping to maintain the 
security and compliance of your system.

The VPN cipher can be configured during slice creation using the cipher parameter in the slice configuration YAML file. The cipher 
value can be set to AES_128_CBC. The default value is AES_256_CBC. This configuration is immutable during the lifetime of a slice.


## Known Issues

* Users can trigger VPN Key Rotation with the `RenewBefore` parameter even before the slice gateways are up and running. 
  This premature rotation attempt often results in failures during the rotation process. Please refrain from triggering VPN 
  Key rotation before the gateways are in a healthy condition to ensure a successful rotation process.
* After detaching a worker cluster from a slice, gateway pods are not deleted.
* In the current version, the rebalancing feature of gateway redundancy is disabled.
* If the helm upgrade fails on the Kubeslice worker, the nsm admission webhook pod does not always clean itself, so you 
  must delete the old nsm webhook pod (from the previous release).

## Issues Fixed

Added a security context at the container level to the NSM init container to enable it to modify the `resolv.conf` file when there 
is a security context at the pod level that is too restrictive.
