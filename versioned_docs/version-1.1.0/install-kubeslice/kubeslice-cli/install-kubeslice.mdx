# Install KubeSlice
Kubeslice-cli is a command-line tool designed to simplify KubeSlice operations on Kubernetes 
and cloud clusters. With this tool, you can easily install the necessary workloads to run the 
KubeSlice Controller and Slice Operator on specific clusters. Additionally, it registers these 
clusters as part of a KubeSlice multi-cluster and manages slices across them.

To use the tool, you provide input in the form of YAML files. The topology YAML file describes 
the cluster membership in the multi-cluster. 

## Create Topology YAML file
To install KubeSlice, you need to create a topology configuration file that specifies the 
controller cluster and the worker cluster names. The file should include other relevant details 
as described in the sample configuration file provided below. This file is essential in setting 
up KubeSlice.

### Sample Topology Configuration File
The following a minimal configuration file to install KubeSlice Enterprise on cloud clusters:

Create the topology configuration file using the following template:
```yaml
configuration:
  cluster_configuration:
    kube_config_path: <path to kubeconfig file>
    controller:
      name: <cluster name acting as controller>
      context_name: <controller cluster context name>
    workers:
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
      - name: <cluster name>
        context_name: <cluster context name>
  kubeslice_configuration:
    project_name: <create project name>
  helm_chart_configuration:
    repo_alias: kubeslice
    repo_url: https://kubeslice.aveshalabs.io/repository/kubeslice-helm-ent-prod/
    cert_manager_chart:
      chart_name: cert-manager
    controller_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-controller
    worker_chart:
      chart_name: kubeslice-worker
```

Custom chart values can be specified in the topology configuration. See [Topology Configuration Parameters](topology-configuration).

## Apply the Topology Configuration YAML
To install KubeSlice using the topology YAML file, use the following command:

```
kubeslice-cli --config <path-to-the-topology.yaml> install
```

:::success
You have successfully installed KubeSlice.
