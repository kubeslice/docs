# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 0.6.0

*Release date: 7th Feb 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

### Latest Supported Kubernetes Version 
The latest Kubernetes version that we support from this release is version [1.24](https://v1-24.docs.kubernetes.io/). 

### Enhancements 
* With the current release, **Slice Gateway** spins up two pairs of gateway pods. With multiple replicas of the VPN pods, 
multiple gateway nodes, and multiple network connections to the remote cluster, we now have mechanisms in place to handle 
failure scenarios effectively.

## Known Issues
The known issues are as follows:

- The Slice Gateway Redundancy is incompatible with the existing slices on the cluster. So, you must create a new slice to 
  use the Slice Gateway Redundancy.
- Sometimes, gateway pods get stuck in the `Init` state due to this [upstream NSM](https://github.com/networkservicemesh/cmd-registry-k8s/issues/362) issue. 
- If a node that contains the application pods and NSM webhook pod scheduled on it is restarted, the NSM containers are not injected into the application pod. 
  This occurs as the NSM webhook pod manages the lifecycle of the NSM `mutatingwebhookconfiguration`.
