Use [kubeslice-cli](/versioned_docs/version-0.5.0/kubeslice-cli/getting-started.mdx) 
to quickly install KubeSlice on cloud clusters. For instructions, 
follow this [demo tutorial](versioned_docs/version-0.5.0/tutorials/kubeslice-cli-demo-on-cloud-clusters.mdx).
This tutorial helps you to register your clusters with the KubeSlice Controller and create a 
slice across the clusters. We have worked to make this experience as seamless as possible.
