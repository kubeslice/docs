[KubeSlice](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0) is a new project in the cloud-native ecosystem that addresses the issues within a multi-cluster multi-tenant Kubernetes environment.
The project combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to create multi-tenancy in a Kubernetes cluster and extends it to a multi-cluster architecture.

It achieves this by creating a logical application boundary known as a **Slice** that allows pods and services to communicate efficiently across clusters, clouds, and data centers.  

### What is a Slice?

A **Slice** is very similar to the **Network Slice* that is predominant in 5G network architectures today. 
[Network Slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_network_slicing) is a method of creating multiple unique **logical** and **virtualized** networks over a common, shared infrastructure. 
We can also liken it to a virtual machine since it is similarly carved out of a large and common infrastructure to enable more efficient utilization & sharing of resources among multiple tenants.

Each network slice is logically separated from the other, is an independent part of the network, and targets different services with different requirements at the same time. This enables to build and manage a network that has the capabilities to meet the emerging requirements from a wide range of users and enable multi-tenancy in a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup.

### Concept of a Slice in KubeSlice

In KubeSlice, a Slice is a Kubernetes [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) defined to implement multi-tenancy in a cluster. 
[Multi-tenancy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/multi-tenancy/) is when a single instance of an application or a single Kubernetes cluster can serve multiple users, called tenants, at the same time without the problems of noisy/nosey neighbor, policy and configuration drift, and resource hogging creeping in.

In order to communicate within a multi-cluster architecture, an overlay network (an application slice) following the RFC1918 protocol is created by KubeSlice that provides seamless connectivity between the pods of an application running in multiple clusters. Existing intra-cluster communication remains local to the cluster utilizing each podâ€™s CNI interface. 

Kubeslice provides isolation of network traffic between clusters by creating an overlay network for inter-cluster communication.

There are a lot of advantages achieved with this way of implementing multi-cluster multi-tenancy in Kubernetes:

- **Better Resiliency** - Resiliency is the ability of an application to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service. Due to the overlay network created by Kubeslice, the application is separated into virtual clusters. The services in any virtual cluster can independently failover without disrupting services in other layers/clusters. These failovers can be done while intra-cluster communication continues at a reduced capacity. Therefore, connections can be re-routed to other clusters in a Slice, which ensures less disruptions and quick recoveries.
By deploying an application across multiple Kubernetes clusters that are connected using this slice overlay network, we are able to achieve resiliency & high availability for the service.

- **Traffic Control** - Each slice in a cluster is associated with a QoS profile for bandwidth control across the clusters. The QoS profile is applied to the external interface of the VPN gateway nodes. To know more about the profile parameters that help us achieve this, refer to the guide on [QOS Profile Parameters](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.2.0/getting-started-with-cloud-clusters/installing-kubeslice/configuration-parameters#qos-profile-parameters).

- **Better App-to-App Connectivity** - Application pods on a Slice have better connectivity between them across multiple cluster boundaries. This is due to the creation of an overlay network for inter-cluster communication. This overlay network provides a dedicated VPN connection within a slice. Therefore, there is no need for the request to transit the internet to establish a connection between apps on a slice. This type of connectivity is referred to as East-West connectivity.

- **Removes IP Addressing Complexities - Overlapping IPs** - The overlay network is configured with a non-overlapping RFC1918 address space which removes the overlapping CNI CIDR concerns. Thus, KubeSlice solves the complex problem of overlapping IP addressing between clusters across cloud providers, data centers etc.
