[KubeSlice](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0) is a new project in the cloud-native ecosystem that addresses the issues within a multi-cluster multi-tenant environment in Kubernetes.
The project combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to create multi-tenancy in a Kubernetes cluster and extends it to a multi-cluster architecture.

It achieves this by creating a logical application boundary known as a **Slice** that allows pods and services to communicate efficiently across clusters, clouds, and data centers.  



### What is a Slice?

A **Slice** is very similar to the **Network Slice* that is predominant in 5G network architectures today. 
[Network Slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_network_slicing) is a method of creating multiple unique **logical** and **virtualized** networks over a common, shared infrastructure. 
We can also liken it to a virtual machine since it is similarly carved out of a large and common infrastructure to enable more efficient utilization & sharing of resources among multiple tenants.

Each network slice is logically separated from the other, is an independent part of the network, and targets different services
with different requirements at the same time. This enables to build and manage a network that has the capabilities 
to meet the emerging requirements from a wide range of users and enable multi-tenancy in a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup.

### Concept of a Slice in KubeSlice

In KubeSlice, a Slice is a Kubernetes [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) defined to implement multi-tenancy in a cluster. 
[Multi-tenancy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/multi-tenancy/) is when a single instance of an application or a single Kubernetes cluster 
can serve multiple users, called tenants, at the same time without the problems of noisy/nosey neighbor, 
policy and configuration drift, and resource hogging creeping in.


KubeSlice creates logical application **slice boundaries** in a cluster that allows pods and services to 
communicate efficiently within a cluster, across clusters on the cloud or datacenters. In order to communicate 
within a multi-cluster architecture, an overlay network (an application slice) following the RFC1918 protocol is 
created by KubeSlice that provides seamless connectivity between the pods of an application running in multiple 
clusters. Existing intra-cluster communication remains local to the cluster utilizing each pod’s CNI interface. 
Kubeslice provides isolation of network traffic between clusters by creating an overlay network for inter-cluster communication.



There are a lot of advantages achieved with this way of implementing multi-cluster multi-tenancy in Kubernetes:

- **Better Resiliency** - Resiliency is the ability of an application to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service. By deploying an application across clusters and connecting using the slice overlay network, application services are able to achieve resiliency.
- **Traffic Control** - The traffic control policy is maintained for all application pods on a slice. To know more about how we achieve traffic control, refer to the [official documentation](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0/).
- **Better App-to-App Connectivity** - Application pods on a Slice have better connectivity between them across multiple cluster boundaries. This is due to the creation of an overlay network for inter-cluster communication. This overlay network provides a dedicated connection within a slice, thus there is no need for the request to transit the internet to establish a connection between apps on a slice. This type of connectivity is referred to as East-West connectivity.
