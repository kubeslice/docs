[KubeSlice](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0) is a new project in the cloud-native ecosystem that addresses the issues of a multi-cluster multi-tenant environment in Kubernetes.
By definition, KubeSlice combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to create multi-tenancy in a Kubernetes cluster and extends it to a multi-cluster architecture.

KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application **Slice** boundaries that allow pods and services to communicate efficiently across clusters, clouds, and data centers.  

A **slice** is one of the key components and in this particular article we will understand what exactly it is and how it enables KubeSlice to tackle the problems of achieving multi-tenancy on a multi-cluster architecture in Kubernetes.


### What is a Slice?

One of the best real-world examples out there of a Slice is the concept of **Network Slicing** in 5G networks today. 
Network Slicing is a method of creating multiple unique **logical** and **virtualized** networks over a common (shared) infrastructure. 
Similar to virtual machines, a network slice is carved out of a large and common infrastructure. 

Each network slice is logically separated from the other, is an independent part of the network, and targets different services
with different requirements at the same time. This enables to build and manage a network that has the capabilities 
to meet the emerging requirements from a wide range of users and enable multi-tenancy in a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup.

### Concept of a Slice in KubeSlice

In KubeSlice, a Slice is a Kubernetes [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) defined to implement multi-tenancy in a cluster. [Multi-tenancy](link to Kubernetes guide on multi-tenancy) is when a single instance of an application or a single Kubernetes cluster can serve multiple users (called tenants) at the same time without the problems of noisy/nosey neighbour, policy and configuration drift, and resource hogging creeping in.


KubeSlice creates logical application **slice boundaries** in a cluster that allows pods and services to communicate efficiently within a cluster, across clusters on the cloud or datacenters. In order to communicate within a multi-cluster architecture, an overlay network (an application slice) following the RFC1918 protocol is created by KubeSlice that provides seamless connectivity between the pods of an application running in multiple clusters.



There are a lot of advantages achieved with this way of implementing multi-cluster multi-tenancy in Kubernetes:

- **Better Resiliency** - Resiliency is the ability of an application to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service. By deploying an application across clusters and connecting using the slice overlay network, application services are able to achieve resiliency.
- **Traffic Control** - The ability to control traffic across nodes and clusters. The traffic control policy is maintained for all application pods on that slice. To know more about how do we achieve traffic control, refer to the [official documentation](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0/).
- **Better App-to-App Connectivity** - Application pods on a Slice have better connectivity between them across multiple cluster boundaries. This is due to the creation of an overlay network for inter-cluster communication. This overlay network provides a dedicated connection within a slice, thus there is no need for the request to transit the internet to establish a connection between apps on a slice. This type of connectivity is referred to as East-West connectivity.
