[KubeSlice](https://kubeslice.io/documentation/open-source/0.3.0) is a new project in the cloud-native ecosystem that addresses the issues of a multi-cluster multi-tenant environment in Kubernetes.
By definition, KubeSlice combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to create multi-tenancy in a Kubernetes cluster and extends it to a multi-cluster architecture.

KubeSlice achieves this by creating logical application **Slice** boundaries that allow pods and services to communicate efficiently across clusters, clouds, and data centers.  

A **slice** is one of the key components and in this particular article we will understand what exactly it is and how it enables KubeSlice to tackle the problems of achieving multi-tenancy on a multi-cluster architecture in Kubernetes.


### What is a Slice?

One of the best real-world examples out there of a Slice is the concept of **Network Slicing** in 5G networks today. 
Network Slicing is a method of creating multiple unique **logical** and **virtualized** networks over a common (shared) infrastructure. 
Similar to virtual machines, a network slice is carved out of a large and common infrastructure. 

Each network slice is logically separated from the other, is an independent part of the network, and targets different services with different requirements at the same time. This enables to build and manage a network, which has the capabilities to meet and exceed the emerging requirements from a wide range of users and that too, at the same time: the concept of multi-tenancy.

### Concept of a Slice in KubeSlice

In terms of Kubernetes, a Slice is a Kubernetes [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) which can be defined, and it basically describes a way to implement multi-tenancy in a cluster. Multi-tenancy is a concept wherein a single instance of an application or a single Kubernetes cluster can serve multiple users (called tenants) at the same time and is able to withstand that much amount of load.

You might be wondering, how does the creation of a Slice an essential part of KubeSlice and helps in achieving the goals of multi-tenancy?

Well, KubeSlice actually creates these logical application **slice boundaries** in a cluster, that allows pods and services to communicate efficiently within a cluster, across clusters as well as on the cloud or any other data center as well. In order to communicate in a multi-cluster architecture, an overlay network (an application slice) is created which provides seamless connectivity between the pods of an application running in multiple clusters.

Therefore, due to this **slice overlay network**, pods are able to communicate seamlessly across cluster boundaries.

You may ask a question here, what are some of the benefits that we get due to the creation of the slice overlay network?

There are a lot of advantages achieved here:

- **Better Resiliency** - In layman's language, Resiliency is the ability of an application to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service. By deploying an application across clusters and connecting using the slice overlay network, application services get better resiliency
- **Traffic Control** - The ability to control traffic across nodes and clusters. The traffic control policy is maintained for all application pods on that slice.
- **Better App-to-App Connectivity** - Application pods on a Slice have better connectivity between them across multiple cluster boundaries.
